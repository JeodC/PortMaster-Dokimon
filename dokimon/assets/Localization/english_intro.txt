10 Hello! Please pardon the intrusion.
11 My name is Rei. I'm a professor and I've made studying Dokimon my life's work.
12 As I'm sure you know, this world is littered with critters we've come to call Dokimon.
13 Over 100 years ago, a comet came crashing down, destroying half of the Earth.
14 After the incident, these Dokimon spread rampant throughout all countries.
15 Due to the comet, and the great war against the Dokimon, 70% of all humans were eradicated.
16 Nowadays, we more or less know which Dokimon are dangerous, and which aren't.
17 Where to go, and where not to go. And how to manage, capture, and befriend certain Dokimon.
18 However, we are still finding out about new monsters almost every day,
19 and there seems to be a never ending supply of new Dokimon discoveries!
20 Nowadays, Dokimon can act as anything from pets, to workers, to lifelong partners!
21 But anyway. You probably knew all of that already.
22 You're supposed to start your journey as a Dokimon Ranger today, isn't that right?
23 Well, you should probably wake up then. Your alarm's been going off all morning!
