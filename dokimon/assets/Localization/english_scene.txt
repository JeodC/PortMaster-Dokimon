900 Hey /name/. Did you want me to heal your Dokimon?
901 Sure, just a sec..
902 . . .
903 There you go! They should be all taken care of.
904 Ok, no worries! Let me know if you want them healed later.

0 You're sure up late!!
1 The professor came by looking for you but you wouldn't wake up.
2 Go find her!! She's probably in the laboratory like usual.

3 Oh yeah, take Whispurr with you! Never know what could happen~

4 *Brriiiii!!*
5 Whispurr joined your party!

6 A-Ai!? Are you ok!?
7 .....
8 ...............
9 Oh my gosh! Don't worry, I'll get you back to town! Come on Whispurr, help me out here..
10 ..............................
11 *12 years ago*

12 Hmm? I'm in the forest?
13 Eh? How did I get here?
14 Oh, I was sleeping, so this must be a dream!
15 Hmm... But if this is a dream... Where's /name/? Where's Ai? Where's Koi?

16 Hmm, it looks like I can't leave the forest..

17 This place is scary! I've never been in the forest at night before..

18 I wish my friends were here, this is a terrible dream!

19 These Dokimon are so scary, go away! Leave me alone!

20 W-what's this? This was never here before. Did a Dokimon do this?
21 Yowch! That's hot, i-is this REAL lava?
22 This is so scary! Wake up, wake up, wake up!!!!
23 Wake up. Ai, wake up!!

24 .......Mai..ko..
25 Huh, Maiko??
26 ...
27 She must be dreaming about Maiko again.. Ai really does miss her after all, we all do..
28 .....
29 Don't worry, Ai. We're going to find her. That's the whole reason we're heading off into this dangerous world.
30 Get as much rest as you need. Koi and I are gonna get a head start on searching for her.
31 ....../n/Let's go find the professor.

32 Hey!!
33 Yo!
34 Sorry for being a debby downer. I was watching you get ready to leave and..
35 I just couldn't let you leave all by yourself!
36 Well, it was Quackfil who helped convince me though. Her wings always find a way to inspire me!
37 It's really sad what happened to Ai, I hope she's gonna be alright..
38 But, she's resting and recovering. I think everything's gonna be ok.
39 Besides, she would never forgive me if I let you leave town without giving you your first battle!!
40 Wow! You're really talented if this is your first Dokimon battle. I'm impressed!

41 Wow!!
42 I already knew you were good at strategy based battles...
43 But battling you in person with real Dokimon is a whole nother experience!
44 Have you been putting in secret training hours with Whispurr behind my back!? Haha.
45 Well.. Whatever it is, now I know more than ever that you're going to turn into an amazing Dokimon Battler.
46 But don't forget who got you into those monster tamer games in the first place!!
47 Hey kids, you forgot something!
48 These little ones wouldn't stop causing a commotion after you guys left.
49 One of them just about caught my printer on fire.. Ahem.
50 Regardless, I don't have it in my heart, nor my wallet.. To keep them away from you any longer!
51 How about you each choose one of these little guys to take with you on your adventures?
52 Whichever two you decide, we'll give Ai the remaining one.
53 Oh yeah, you're also going to need these!
54 *Received a D-Tech*	
55 This D-Tech will let you exchange your monsters without needing to use a PC.
56 You'll probably have to be in a town to use it though. It's not often that you can use your D-Tech in a route.
57 There's also some other nifty apps on there, like the Dokifolio, and Worldmap functions!
58 Anyways, these little guys are growing tireless. Which ones did you want to take with you?.
59 Wow!! This is so exciting, oh my gosh!
60 Ooh!! I think I'm gonna go with Squibbly, no no, Burnsby! Ahh, but look at Bulbapod's puppy dog eyes..
61 Oh oh I can't decide. You pick one first! I'll pick one of the two that's leftover. No hard feelings!
62 Great! Now that that's settled.. Who will it be?

63 Muahahahaha!!
64 Who would've thought it would be this easy!
65 by harnessing the power of...
66 and then sending her into a rage....
67 It's beautiful, those three are even more powerful than the legends have told!
68 The X'ers strike again, mua ha ha!

69 Hey! Nice try but you can't do that.

70 That's quite far enough..
71 Who are you? What business do you have here?
72 No no.. None of that matters. What matters now is that you made it here.
73 Did you know? Not even any of the Xer Grunts you beat have ever been down here.
74 Your luck just ran out, kid. Prepare for a world of hurt!
75 Darn, that was the only Dokimon I had on hand..

76 What do we do? Who even is this kid and why is he destructing our plans?
77 I don't know. Maybe they live here and are upset with the snow monster destroying the town?
78 ...
79 That would be a pretty good guess if you ask me.
80 Alright kid, look. Is that what you want? We'll call off the plan, but don't come looking for us.
81 This is a one time free pass since you showed us some grit.
82 And, we're just about done gathering information anyway...
83 So there you go. You won, we'll leave. But if we ever see you again, there'll be no holding back for real this time.
84 So don't get confident kid. This was a small scale information heist, our other bases are the real deal.
85 ...
86 I'm serious, don't follow us!!
87 ......
88 This kid don't talk very much huh.

89 Hmm? What's that? You're on an adventure looking for a lost friend of yours?
90 Sure, I can give you a hand. That's what us professors are for! Let me see a picture.
91 You show the professor a picture of Maiko from 12 years ago, before she disappeared.
92 Hmm hmm, hmm hmm.. Interesting!
93 This little girl here right? Well, unfortunately this town doesn't get much Dokimon action.
94 However, the next town over has some weird.. Mysteries, that pop up from time to time.
95 I can't say if it has anything to do with your little friend here, but I have heard some rumors.
96 Apparently, there have been reports of seeing a young girl, or possibly a humanoid Dokimon at night.
97 There's also a really powerful sage that lives in a shrine over there. She can definitely help out.
98 If you go straight East from here, you can reach the next town through a cave system.
99 However.. It looks like you haven't defeated any Guardian Rangers yet.
100 Guardian Rangers restrict outsiders from entering dangerous areas, and those caves are one of those places.
101 However, since you're a Dokimon Ranger you'll be able to go there if you defeat Haru.
102 He wanders around here and the town below us, but I think I saw him around here recently. Go try finding him!

103 Wow! Congratulations /name/. You did a great job!
104 With this, you'll be able to pass through the caves and go on to the next town.
105 You've certainly earned the right to do so, but be careful nonetheless!
106 With that said, let me mark your victory in your Ranger ID Card. With a Gemstone!
107 . . . . .
108 There you go! You're all set. Good luck with your adventures!

109 Hey /name/! We were just looking for you, looks like you made it here too huh?
110 Speaking of looking for people, where's the Ranger for this town anyway?
111 Hmmm. No telling huh? I didn't see them anywhere in town.
112 Anyway, how about you show me how much your team has grown since last time!
113 Whoa, your team has come a long way since we left Lillywood!

114 Wow this is great, you're becoming a real, bona-fide Dokimon Ranger huh!
115 Also, I think Ai had something she wanted to talk to you about.
116 I'm gonna go look for the Ranger for this town so that I can move on to the next area.
117 Have fun you two!

118 ...
119 Hey /name/. I just wanted to ask to go together with you for a little bit,
120 I didn't get to give you a proper send off from home, and.. I'm not very good at battling just yet so.
121 Let's adventure together for a little bit, yea?
122 Oh, but don't worry! I won't be completely useless. I can heal your monsters whenever you need it!
123 . . . .
124 Ai joined your party!

125 Well well well. You did good to beat me /name/.
126 But the whispers tell me that wasn't the root of your goals for coming here.
127 Tell me, what can I do for you?
128 You tell Aki the story about your childhood friend who disappeared long ago.
129 I see. So your friend disappeared without a trace...
130 ..and you've been looking for her with your friends ever since you hit the age requirement to become a Ranger.
131 You hand Aki the picture you're carrying of your lost friend Mako.
132 . . . .
133 Well. You did well to come find me, /name/.
134 One thing I can tell you is that your friend is indeed alive.
135 I can't tell you how nice it is to be able to say that.
136 I have people come to see me and ask about lost loves nearly daily..
137 ..but it's been a while since I could confirm someone's wellbeing.
138 . . . .
139 Your friend is certainly alive, but.. There's something else here. There's a powerful force very near her.
140 . . . .
141 It almost seems like she's sleeping, far below the crust of the Earth, surrounded by lava.
142 There are others with her too, though I can't make out if they're human or..
143 . . . .
144 Hmm, this is a peculiar case indeed. Though, there are many mysteries behind my powers after all.
145 I fear that's all the information I can give to you.. But, there is one thing we might be able to try.
146 I will be heading out to an island in a few days. There is a nefarious group there that is causing havoc.
147 This team assembles extremely powerful Dokimon, and uses their powers for evil and destruction.
148 This island is not far from here, so it's possible they're housing a Mythical Dokimon again.
149 If we take out their base of operations, I might be able to get a clearer image of your lost friend Mako.
150 Think about it. You've just unlocked the ability to go out to sea as a Dokimon Ranger after all.
151 I have to tend to some matters now, but I hope to see you there. Good luck, /name/.

152 Wow!!! Mako is alive and well, that's such fantastic news!
153 My God, I'm tearing up. We just learned such big news so quickly after starting our adventures.
154 I know we still have a long way to go, but it feels like we just made so much progress all at once.
155 Wow.. This world really is filled with such amazing people huh. We've met leading scientists, and now a Sage.
156 I think I'm gonna go find Koi and relay the news to her, but you should start heading to that island ASAP!
157 Thanks so much for taking me along with you on a few of your Dokimon battles by the way.
158 I feel like I was really able to learn a lot, I'm gonna catch up to you guys soon and battle alongside you all!
159 We're really gonna do this, /name/. We're gonna save Mako.
160 ...
161 Right, I'm gonna go catch up with Koi. See you later /name/!

162 Oh, why if it isn't /name/, you got here fast!
163 What? Me? Oh, I hopped on the jet, so of course I'm here before you silly.
164 Anyway, you're here on good timing, I was just speaking with one of the Black Belt Bro Masters.
165 Here's the situation. From what we know, the Xer's have taken up shop in a home that's next to the caves.
166 They've since installed some kind of door or tunnel that branches from that house and into the caves.
167 So far, one of the Black Belt Bros was able to sneak in, but they didn't get too far. Slipped on a banana peel.
168 Since then, they've increased security that waits past the initial entrance.
169 We need a skilled Dokimon Ranger like you to get in there and battle your way into the front lines.
170 While you're in there kicking up smoke and causing a commotion, the Black Belt Bros and I are gonna swoop in.
171 Ahh, but there's an issue.. It looks like they're done with easy passwords and gone with something complex.
172 No one's been able to crack the new code unfortunately, we're gonna need that first to get you in there.
173 . . . .
174 Hmm, quiet. My powers seem to be useless here. They must have some powerful Dokimon here after all.
175 We're gonna have to brute force ourselves in another way.
176 . . . .
177 Right, I've got it.
178 Listen close /name/. There's a ship near this island with an old Captain friend of mine.
179 But this Captain has a terrible secret.. Despite being a hardy sailor type, he loves to knit!
180 The old man owes me a favor. If you find him, tell him we need an Xer's Uniform.
181 What? Ahh, don't worry. As soon as you mention "knitting" he'll comply without hesitation.
182 He's a hardy type, but he's soft when it comes to things like that.
183 Alright, you go work on that. I'm gonna put together something with the Black Belt Bros to get you that password!

184 Oi, look oo's back aye', got a lad oo's urtin' to join our crew I reckon'
185 ...
186 Hello lad, what business do you have with us?
187 *You explain to them everything that's happened recently.*
188 .......................
189 It's a REALLY long story..
190 Aye' I reckon' urr' the hero type aye'? But either way we aren' letchin' ya talk to ole' Cap.
191 Your eart' pullin story won't work on me champ, 'e're on guard duty today I reckon'.
192 You tell them Aki sent you to meet the Captain.
193 Erry'one and aer' mother knows Aki, sorry kid but cha' gonna need a better lie en' that to get pass us.
194 ......
195 *You hesitantly mention the Captain's Knitting hobby..*
196 AHHH AR AR AR!!
197 Well I'll be! You DO know ole' Cap'n, Aki sure nd't tell no stranger about that!
198 Uur' lucky ya got yaself some old heads guardin' today, the rookies woulda laughed ya to Bay to Bay!
199 Al'right, we're let cha inside chap, just walk straight to im', don't let nonatha Sailor wads bully ya!

200 Hey! Where are you going? You need that outfit to bust up the bad guys!
201 Don't worry, you'll be able to leave soon. Try asking around if your team is low on HP!

202 So. Is this the young whipper snapper that's been terrorizing my crew aye'.
203 What business ave you got with me mate?
204 . . .
205 Aki ye' say.. Er' name is known world wide mate, you're gonna need a lot more than that to convince me!
206 . . .
207 A suit! The Xer's?? What are ya' talking about mate, you like to cosplay er something?? ARR AR AR AR!
208 *You take a deep, deep breath.*
209 Oi, ye alright mate?
210 . . .
211 CAPTAIN'S HOBBY IS KNITTING, AND SEWING CUTE CLOTHES, AND CUTE LITTLE ANIMALS, AND, AAAND
212 OI OI MATEY! Let's not get ahead of ourselves 'ere!
213 Yarsh, if she be tellin' yer that, then ye've really know Aki close then donchya..
214 Right, I do owe er' a favor... Alright mate, give me the details, but just please.. Keep your voice down!
215 . . .
216 I see.. Seems like they're being put through quite the hassle over ere' in that island aye!
217 Hmm hmm.. Well, alright. I can do it but, I really wish ole Aki had someone better to ask..
218 This Xer group ye speak of seems to be mostly just a bunch of amateurs..
219 They should know a stylish outfit be key to a successful radical group!
220 Something like this can be replicated easily, making it easy to blend in with their group.
221 Wait ere' a minute kiddo, I'll have a convincing outfit ready for you in jiffy!
222 . . .
223 Well do ya look spiffy as ever if I say myself! I bonafied Xer I reckon.
224 That should do just the trick. Ye best be tellin' Aki my favor to er' been repaid in full ye hear!
225 Yosh, on with ya mate. Get outta my site, best before me crew start gettin' strange ideas..

226 Oh my! Well aren't you looking quite snazzy there.
227 I see you were able to get the outfit made no problem, job well done!
228 I'll have to thank Cap' on my way back home later.
229 Anyways, you look just the part! I think it's about time to send those Xer's packing.
230 Think you can do it? Their base is just in the little house left from here, next to the water.
231 Ah yes! And I almost forget, we cracked that passcode while you were gone.
232 The password is 888, you're gonna need it to get in to their base, so don't forget it!
233 Right then. I'm not sure what exactly the plan is once you get in there..
234 But if you bust up enough of those goons and cause a commotion, it might give me the opportunity to slip in.
235 And once that happens, they're history. The Black Belt Bro's have been hurting for a chance to get back at them.
236 Anyway, just get in there and mess em' around and we'll come kicking doors down behind you soon after.
237 And remember, the password is just three digits. 8-8-8. Best of luck!

238 Good work out there comrade. Looking to enter Central?
239 Alright. Well, you know the routine. What's the password?
240 8-8-8
241 Heh. This new password is genius huh? Every time the Black Belters cracked it, we added a digit.
242 They'll never expect us to go from 7 digits, to 3!! And much less a repeating number.. Muahaha!
243 Anyway, you're good to go. Make sure you rest up well so you can get back to work tomorrow!

244 Hey, what are you a rookie? This sections under construction. No entry!

245 Hey!
246 No one is allowed to be back here! How did you get here anyway?
247 Xer grunts are not allowed to have a Dokimon team with all three of the primary elements.
248 This could get you exiled! And you know what happens after that, a good ole' brain re-arranging. It's not fun.
249 Well, not that I would know. . Doesn't exactly sound pleasant though.
250 You, get over here and show me your team at once.
251 . . . . .
252 Wait a second!
253 I recognize some of these monsters. . You're not really an Xer at all are you!?
254 Wait, don't do that-
255 ! ! !
256 Yikes! That was a real explosion. . I felt the shockwave ripple through my bones!
257 I knew I shouldn't have let that guy install this. .
258 It just sounded so cool! Why was that guy so convincing anyway. .
259 I'm a General! I can't let my inner child come out as soon as someone starts talking about explosions.
260 Hold it right there!
261 Your shenanigans stop here, criminal scum!
262 Omg, omg.. I've always wanted to say that!
263 Ahem. . Oh! There you are /name/!
264 I have to say /name/, just wow!! Genius, just genius.. To think you had time to even rig up explosions.
265 Truly, it's no wonder Prof. Rei speaks so highly of you!
266 *At that moment, a silent agreement between two enemies was made.*
267 Backup is here /name/, it's time to show these Xer's some kick-butt, the butt kicking of a life time!
268 "Not so fast!"
269 Muahaha! Did you forget where you are? This is Xer's Central! and soon this will be OUR island!
270 Soon, this WHOLE island will be ours! X island.. it's going to be marvelous!
271 MUA HA HA HA!
272 But wait, there's more where that came from!
278 Oh no!
279 Erk, this is a bit more than I thought I was getting myself in to..
280 /name/! You're gonna have to make do on your own for a little bit..
281 We'll take care of things here as best as we can. .
282 You just go on ahead and get to the bottom of what's going on in here, hurry!
283 You made a run for it and collected your Dokimon on the way.
284 Afterwards, you found yourself in a scene similar to the one near your home.

285 Hey! What are you doing? I don't think it's a good idea to go back that way..

286 Heyo! Unfortunately, this is the end of the currently implemented content.
287 However, this is the direction you're supposed to go next.
288 Please try coming back here after the game is updated!

289 . . .
290 There's a weird tension in the air..
291 . . . .
292 You suddenly feel like you're going to be sick.
292 . . . . . . .
293 The air has become thick as mud.
294 . . . . . . . . . . . . 
295 You blacked out.
296 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
297 We wrestle not/n/against flesh and blood..
298 but against principalities
299 and against the worldly governors
300 worldly governors/n/worldly governors/n/worldly governors
301 They are the princes of/n/darkness in this world

313 You will find nothing if/n/I have anything to say about it
314 Nothing.

316 What is it you wish to achieve?

318 You are worthless.
319 You will never find me
320 You will never defeat me
321 You are.. I am..
322  
323 Begone from me

324 . . .
325 Tell me, how did you find yourself here?
326 . . . . .
327 I have no contract with you. Leave this place at once.
328 . . . . . . .
329 Hmm?
330 . . . . . . . . .
331 Wait. You are looking for me, aren't you?
332 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
333 HA HA HA HA
334 Hmm, perhaps HE arranged this..
335 . . .
336 Let me tell you, young one. I will give you one piece of advice.
337 If you made a deal with me here today, like many adults have before you.
338 It shall be sealed. Signed in blood. It is unto death, there is no light, there is no escape.
339 And in your final days when you cry out, tell me.. What could you possibly give to me?
340 What of your achievements, and your worldly possessions, your experiences, your connections, your livelihood..
341 What could you possibly give to me in exchange for your soul?
342 Place your soul in your hands. Cover it. Nurture it. And run with it.
343 Your body is but a vessel. And the life you know is temporary. But your soul is forever.
344 Yes. Remember that. Now go back to your disgusting, puppeted world. You have no place here.
345 I hope we never meet again.

346 What's going on...
347 Where am I-ouch! Yikes../n/I have one of the worst headaches of my life!
348 I listened to creepy voices in my head, voices I've never heard before..
349 I feel like I can still feel that dark presence a little bit even now.
350 Is this what happened to Maiko too? Is she being held by these things??
351 . . .
352 I have so many questions, but it looks like Aki can help us get to the bottom of this soon.
353 I wish my friends were here now.. But not even I know where I am at the moment.
354 I'm all alone..
355 Well. Maybe it's not so bad. I have Aki with me recently, and she's super strong!
356 Yeah. It's gonna be alright. I'm gonna figure this out and give my friends a call!
357 I'll do anything to save Maiko.. I'm gonna do it!
358 Let's go find Aki and get to the bottom of this.

359 Can I go home yet?? It's been hours. What am I even doing here!
360 This place is creepy. YOU'RE creepy! ..
361 And you talk funny.
362 . . . .
363 I wanna see /name/!
364 Your friends cannot reach you here.
365 Besides, time here doesn't pass the same...
366 To you what's only been a few hours, has already been years to your friends.
367 Hmph. Stupid monster.
368 If it's been years then my friends should already be old enough to have become Rangers by now.
369 I bet they're looking for me already. Yeah!
370 You'll see, when they come and beat you up!

371 Why are you here?
372 Maiko!! Is that you? Is this where you've been all this time? I finally found you!
373 Your search for me is futile.
374 You will never find me.
375 MAIKO WAIT!
376 Don't go...
377 WHAT WAS THAT!??
378 There's some dark energy at play here. I have no idea who or WHAT that was, but we need to get inside NOW.
379 Come on, this place isn't some kind of playground.
380 There's a reason why strong monsters and trainers gather here...

381 Alright. Remember, we're in this together, /name/.
382 It's probably gonna get kinda scary in here. This place is the most connected to this realm we can get.
383 So my powers are going to be working at full capacity, and you're going to be there for all of it.
384 You'll be able to experience these visions just as much as I'm going to.
385 But just remember. None of this is real. Nothing we see can sense or hurt us.
386 And in the worst case that we encounter something else in there, I can protect you.
387 But the chances of that are extremely low.
388 Anyway. Let's dive right in! To Maiko!
389 . . .
390 . . . . . . .
391 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
392 . . . . . . . . 
393 You shouldn't have/n/come here again..
394 Ack!
395 At the sound of Aki's scream, you opened your eyes and looked over.
396 She laid on the floor, completely unconscious. With a large gash over one of her eyes.
397 She was immediately air lifted to the big city to get treated.
398 . . .
399 Your great sage has been struck down... What will you do now?
999 "/name/ is not alone."

400 It's a real shame about Aki...
401 We're both extraordinarily busy but, whenever we had the opportunities to meet it was on good terms.
402 We got along well. Aki is the only one I know that has strange powers similar to me after all.
403 *You tell Professor Rei about the visions and experiences with Aki.*
404 . . .
405 I won't lie to you /name/, I've had strange visions and whispers about Maiko too. Dreams even.
406 My powers aren't quite the same as Aki's. Going to certain places doesn't give me visions or increase my power.
407 It's more like, at the right time things just come into my brain. Especially when I'm working.
408 It's like all the work is done in the background and I'm just presented with the answer.
409 Sometimes I only vaguely understand how I came to the answer, but other times I don't know at all.
410 So me and the team will put those thoughts and experiments to the test and see what we can make of them.
411 But.. sometimes, I feel an intense, creeping feeling. Like as if every hair on my body stands up at once.
412 And other times I get intense sensations of needing to flee.
413 It's gotten me out of some tricky situations, but there were times where I only had time to prepare to fight.
414 But going back to Maiko, I've always felt she was out there somewhere. Some days I feel like she's watching us.
415 Occasionally I'll start to get feelings of doubt, like I've just been fooling myself this entire time.
416 But whenever I get overcome with those feelings of grief, something beckons out to me.
417 And when that happens, I can feel all the pain, regret, doubt, and sense of despair flow out from me and vanish.
418 Regardless, we've come this far.
419 We're finally getting an edge over these Dokimon creatures.
420 Not only have we become capable of capturing, training, and battling with them.
421 But we've also found that we can raise Dokimon to be far stronger than they could've gotten without our guidance.
422 But... One thing I'm certain of, is that there are powerful creatures at play in this world. More intelligent than us.
423 Princes of darkness.. Powers behind things like what happened with Maiko. And now Aki has been...
424 Anyway, I'm gonna catch your friends up to speed on what's happened with you.
425 They've been hurdled up on training grounds, and Ai is just about caught up to speed!
426 I think you'll be adventuring alongside them a lot more from now on, starting with this city.
427 I'll ring them and make sure they know you're here.
428 For now, just focus on finding Tobi, he's the Ranger of this big city.
429 I won't spoil any Ranger secrets, but defeating Tobi is going to give you a huge advantage in your adventures.
430 If you want a hint, Koi knows a little more about that than you or Ai, but I doubt she'll tell you either!
431 Right. Defeat Tobi, conquer this city, and then we'll meet again and regroup.
432 Hopefully Aki will be awake and moving around again by the time you take care of that.

433 What's wrong with this city...
434 First Aki got hurt, now people are trying to over over the biggest city and Xelos region.
435 And there's all of these weird, shadowy Dokimon. They look possessed!
436 What's going on... I just wanted to find Maiko, now I just want to help Aki.
437 But nobody can get anything done with these stupid Xer's blocking off entire cities!
438 I need to hurry up and take care of them so that I can find the Ranger here, and get back on track...
439 Seriously, just.. What's wrong with this city!

440 Huh? Hey! That's not who I think it is, is it!?
441 . . .
442 It is! Boss, this is the one I was telling you about!
443 They're the ones that put a stop to our plans in that small town.
444 Wait, they were involved with the island too. My grunts said they saw them with with Aki!!
445 . . .
446 So this is the little scoundrel that's given me such a headache is it...
447 Let me take care of this. This is the center of our operations, we cannot allow them fumble our plans any longer.
448 Listen up kid. What lies behind this door is the secret behind the Bound Dokimon you've been seeing.
449 That is the one thing we cannot allow for anyone to find out. Prepare yourself, this is gonna hurt!
450 Hold it right there!
451 Huh!?
452 So this is where you've been all this time...
453 Wha- That can't be. This voice... There's no way-
454 Shut it, Xe!
455 I know everything now!
456 I know how you took over Yor City, and let your goons rampant all over there.
457 All the while your true operations were going down right here in Xelos!
458 And I know how you've been creating contracts with entities, and Binding Dokimon too!
459 /name/, this guy is essentially trying to re-create a God Dokimon. It's horrible!
460 He's been forcing Dokimon into Bindings against their will to eventually Bind a Mythic Dokimon!
461 For a silly little group you sure have some big ambitions, huh Xe...
462 Enough with the talk! Did you come here to fight or chit-chat??
463 Mmmm... this might get rough /name/.
464 They each have 6 Dokimon.. Bound Dokimon. and they're likely gonna force doubles onto us.
465 Look. I trust you, we'll take them on at the same time! I got the left one, you take Xe.
466 We'll beat them at their own game, 4v4!

467 Ack, that smarts... and it looks like they got a lot of company while we were locked into an intense match.
468 I don't have much left in me /name/, but I have one trump up my sleeve... You need to go on ahead. I got this!
469 Go!

470 So you finally made it here...
471 The torture I've gone through as these idiots attempted to make me into what my father is.
472 I'm Magma. I'm one of the Mythic Dokimon your friend spoke of. But I've never spoke to you before.
473 Who you spoke with is my father who has completely fallen to darkness.
474 His heart has been closed off, and he sees nothing but hate. He doesn't even recognize his own family.
475 What this group has been trying to do is force me into a contract, similar to the Dokimon they fight with.
476 So that they could be in control of a Dokimon as powerful as my father in his rage.
477 Foolish acts... I told them countlessly, it would only destroy all of them.
478 It's a miracle you and your friends will be able to put a stop to it before they were able to complete their plan.
479 Now. Battle with me, /name/. If you have what it takes to defeat or capture me,
480 You will be that much closer to defeating my father. And... to finding your friend Maiko, too.
481 I don't know why he took her all those years ago, but she has been with him in the Shadow World ever since.
482 Let's put an end to this.

483 Go to her
484 "Huh?"/n/"To who?"
485 To Aki../n/She is ready to wake up now.
486 Go to her.
487 You must get there before/n/others get to her first.

488 ...succeed
489 Maybe I'm not capable of succeeding after all..
490 NO
491 No..?
492 People can succeed, if they try.
493 But people's concept of their best is generally flawed..
494 The idea of "your best", or your friends' and family's perception of "your best" won't be enough.
495 So what am I supposed to do then, Hana?
496 You have to give up everything.
497 If you do that, there is nothing that can stand in your path.
498 But what if I really do my best and it's still not enough?
499 There is no such thing.
500 Work hard and you will become a great leader. But be lazy, and surely you will be enslaved.
501 . . .
502 I'll do it, for /name/. But...
503 What will it cost?
504 All of you.
505 Will I die?
506 There is no such thing as death. There is only change, time, and separation. You know that very well.
507 . . .
508 I can't do this alone..
509 Aki.
510 You are not alone.
920 . . . . . .
921 Maybe I'm not. But everywhere I go is surrounded in darkness.
922 There's voices. Monsters. Wizardry. Evil spirits. People after me. Puppet masters and governors..
923 If there is nothing but darkness around you, it only means you are meant to be the light.
924 . . . . . .
925 You're right.
926 I'm not alone. And right now, I have people depending on me.
511 Aki: Hey, /name/.
512 I know what we have to do.
513 Come on,/n/we're going to my hometown.

998 So you finally made it here did you...
997 I am Gad'riel, the ruler of this petty world.
514 I take it you're here to take from me my only company,
515 Right, the girl... Maiko, was it.
516 She never stopped talking about her silly friends. I never thought I'd actually see the day they came here.
517 Right.. Why is it that I brought her here again?
518 . . .
519 I don't remember. Nothing is ever recorded anymore.
520 The only thing these eyes see is....
521 Yes, that's right. Destruction...... Destroy, rest, destroy, rest again.
522 I came to a planet with my army of warriors and destroyed nearly the entire planet.
523 And then.
524 . . .
525 I was resting, and there was a young girl.
526 Perhaps there was a similar character in my life before the darkness.
527 . . . . . .
528 Regardless, do what it is you've come here to do.
529 I will throw everything I have at you.

530 I see...
531 To think a human is capable of making it this far.
532 You have earned the right to face me, human.
533 If you defeat me here and now in the flesh, I'll leave this planet to you.
534 But be that the case, pray I don't return when my strength is fully recovered.
535 You're facing the destroyer of worlds himself! What fate will befall you?

536 I see.
537 I will leave this planet.
538 You're free to do with the girl as you wish. However.
539 The human mind cannot withstand the kind of exposure she got to this place.
540 She will not be the same girl you grew up with.
541 If you wish to fully restore her to the girl you know her as, then I'm afraid your adventure has only just started.
542 Unfortunately, telling you how to restore her wasn't part of the deal.
543 Farewell.
544 To be continued...
545 Dear players,/n/a message from Yana
546 Hey guys! Thank you/n/for playing my game :)
547 Dokimon: Quest was an/n/incredible adventure for me!
548 I wonder what new/n/adventures I will go on next
549 Whatever it is,/n/Thanks for coming along ♡
550 Hope to see you in/n/the next one too!
551 ♡♡♡

600 Good. I'm glad you were able to live up to the expectations Aki set for you.
601 With this victory no one should bother you about wandering around these parts.
602 This area is extremely dangerous, so a lot of Rangers not only train here, but also protect these locations.
603 You'll have to defeat the remaining Rangers to move on to the last town Aki told you about
604 That town is the resting place of Gad'riel, the Dark one who caused the near destruction of our planet.
605 Aki is sure that Maiko is being kept in Gad'riels domain.
606 The domain goes by many names. The underworld, the shadow realm, the dark world, etc...
607 It's kept on the hush-hush of course, so it doesn't really have an official realm.
608 Only people that live in that village, and select Rangers and professors know of it's existence.
609 But, due to Gad'riel's domain, a lot of the bound monsters you battled against are nearby it...
610 The Xer's found out about these bound monsters, and found out how to make contracts with Dokimon also.
611 Once they found that out, they started making lots of contracts, and sacficing lots of... souls.
612 It's really a long, dark, and not very fun story.
613 Anyway. All I really want to say is... Be careful.
614 You're not alone. Aki is watching over you, and all of the Rangers are watching you too.
615 You got this, /name/. We're rooting for you. Go get em'!

630 Yikes, that was intense. I haven't battled in a long time.
631 Looks like they've already gone back to their usual guard posts huh.
632 Anyways, this is the final stretch, /name/.
633 Gad'riel is resting here, just up ahead.
634 Did you know? This town was built around Gad'riel's final resting place, all those years ago.
635 Ever since, it's been a training ground for the strongest Rangers in the world.
636 If you need to train any before facing the big bad boss, I'm sure there'll be plenty to learn here.
637 Choi will definitely be happy if you went and trained with her too!
638 Anyway, I'm gonna be in the onsen til you finish your journey.
639 After that, I'll finally go back to my shrine. Take as much time as you need to prepare for your fight!






990 What are you doing! We can't go this way right now..
