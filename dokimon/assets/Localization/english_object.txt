Right???

Ranger tips!/n/Did you know you can change monsters moves at any time?
Just navigate to a monster and press info, and then press an Enter key on their moves.
Additionally, you can edit stats earned by leveling up whenever you want.
Lastly, each monster has some stats when you find them. These increase through affinity!
To increase a monsters affinity with you, battle together with them and feed them berries!
.

Oh no, a monster is terrorizing the area!

106
Ranger tips!/n/Monsters earn "EP's" while leveling up. You can invest Experience Points into your stats.
EP's may not be very effective at low levels, but they go a long way once your monster gets stronger.
Additionally, monsters also have "AP's". Each monster is assigned some Affinity Points when you get them.
You can max out your monsters AP's by maxing out their affinity, which increases during Ranger battles.

Well well well, so you've found yourself in a fractured reflection of the past...
How the heck did you end up here!?
Anyway... Battlers in the Ha\\na region exist outside the rules of our world, so they're incredibly strong!

Find and "collect" them all for the special prize of...
Nothing!
.

206
Did you know? You weren't able to choose which monster you could switch to in Nuumonsters!
The devs later decided that this was a terrible idea, and thus dropped the idea when making Dokimon: Quest...
.

207
Watch out! Battlers in the Fractured Ha\\na region are incredibly strong!
It might be a good idea to rest up before taking them on.
.

208
Each route in the Ha\\na region has exactly 4 or 5 monsters you can find.
Did you know? Some Dokimon routes had more than 10 possible monsters!
.

209
Come get anything you need from the best AR shop in town!

It's an incredibly beautiful painting!!!
Or, at least I think it's supposed to be... I can't really make out the details.

225
Ranger Tips from another Universe!/n/Some monsters can be captured with Theft Captals.
However, this is only possible when capturing Bound monsters, and during single battles.
You'll find the Xer's often times wield Bound monsters, but they're not the only ones.
For example, cult members (like the Yumeko cult... fan club???) also use Bound monsters.
But be careful when using Theft Captals! The battle will end, and you won't be able to rebattle.
.

226
It's an adorable plushie, you desperately want to squish it.
