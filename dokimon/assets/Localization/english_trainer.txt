Oh, what's this. A challenge? Ha! You're gonna regret challenging ME to a battle!
Why I have the strongest team in town, no, in the entire region!
.
0
How did you beat me, surely you're cheating. You're a cheater!!!
.

1
Let's make this quick, I have a hair appointment after this.
.
1
Boo, I was hoping to brag about this battle to my hair stylyst..
.


2
This is my intro message!
.
2
This is my outtro message (after I lose)!
.

3
You'll never be able to beat me when my sister's here to cheer me on!
.
Oh no.. I guess I can't win on cheer power alone..
.

4
Don't mess with us! We're going to be the strongest Dokimon duo this world has ever seen!
.
Well, I suppose the path to becoming strong is filled with many failures..
.

5
Waha!! You fell into my trap, I knew standing next to a Rangers Tips sign would attract challengers!
.
Ouch, maybe I should go stand next to a different sign..
.

6
Whoa! What are you doing in here?? No kids allowed!
.
Yikes, this kids got some spunk!!!
.


7
Hey ho! Joke ends here kiddo, I'll send you flying home with my devious duo!
.
Eek! I guess cats and birds don't get along after all..
.

8
Nuh-uh, sorry kiddo, but this is really the last straw.
Just past this last staircase is the boss man, and if he sees you..
I don't even wanna imagine what'll happen to the likes of me, yeep!
.
Yeep! Oh no, the boss is gonna, he's gonna.. ah!
.


9
It's quite boring these days, and this heat is killing me. Wanna kill some time?
.
Ooh, that certainly was a good way to pass the time. 
.


10
Finally, a challenger! I've been in this smelly place for ages waiting for a decent fight!!
.
All that suffering for nothing... *Sob, I wanna go home..
.

11
Look at all these Flounder, they're so cuuuuuute!
.
Yeep! How could you defeat my cuties!?
.

12
Yeehaw a challenger! I knew coming to this town was a good idea. Let's get er' rollin'!
.
Oh no! Looks like we've gotta do some more training..
.

13
Welcome /name/! It's a pleasure to have you here in my home.
How do you like it, don't you just love Flounder?
I could never battle with them, but they make great friends!
Right. Without further Ado, let's get right into this. Haru's not holding back!
.
Wow! I didn't know we had a child prodigy on our hands, you go kid!
.

14
Master Haru won't battle with Flounder, but I sure will!
.
Ouch! Is this the real reason he doesn't battle with flounder?
.

15
Hey-ho it's a battle! I've been stuck on this mountain for ages.
If I let you win will you help me find my way out??
.
Heesh, city folk sure are strong! Any luck on those directions?
.

16
Hello. I am Elite Ranger Hana. 
If you defeat me you'll be able to go on Dokimon adventures even amidst watery terrains.
What do you say, are you up for the challenge?
.
Hehehe, you fell for my trap. My master's name is not even Hana, Muahaha!
.

17
Hello. Please excuse my disciple Hana, she is such a trickster sometimes..
I am Fude, the Elite Ranger of these parts, protector of the sea.
My Dokimon battles are as beautiful and elegant as my brush strokes, what do you say?
.
That was not very elegant of me.. My battle skills need work, but lying is my forte!
.

18
O-oh, hello!.. Did you already battle with my disciples??
Oh! I see, those twins sure are something else huh.. Always fooling people!
Ha ha.. I-I'm Saki, an Elite Ranger! I spend most of my time tending the gardens here..
But occasionally, kind people like you come to challenge me so that they can travel on water.
A-anyway, let's get this battle started, before my flowers start to wilt..
.
My garden is weeping.. Oh master, I'm afraid this one was too strong for me..
.

19
Hello /name/. You've done well to make it past my sisters and meet me here.
As I'm sure you heard from them, battling with me will grant you the priviledge to battle in the sea.
This means you'll be able to travel to new towns on your own, and surf on the waves alongside your Dokimon.
I have no advice or warnings to give to you, beating my elite team will be proof of your strength.
.
The whispers were right, a battler like you only comes around every few centuries.
.


20
Whoa! Who art' thee? Ye've got quite the nerve to be waltzin' round' this ere' ship aye!
Aye mite, I got a riddle for ya..
Three letters to start a word. It's not today, it's not tomorrow.. What are the first three letters of the word?
.
ARRR ARR AR!! Ye fell for me trap. But alas', me heart wasn't in the battle..
.

21
Are' mate.. I appreciate you sendin' ole' bucko packin' earlier.
Ee's a real pain in my side. Always jabbin' along and playing pranks.
And a real sore sort when you try playin' im' with his own tricks ya hear..
So let ask ye something, did ee' trick ya into battling with a stupid question?
.
Did I trick you too, or was I playing into your hand all along?
.

22
Hey hey well this is a battle if I've ever seen one!
I'm so so bored. All I do all day is guard this stupid life boat..
If you wanna battle with me, you can come challenge me anytime!
In fact, how about having a battle with me right now?
.
The heat of battle always gets me fired up, win or lose!
.

23
Abra-kadabra.. Alaka-Whoa! Don't scare me like that!! I was just practicing my best trick.
Oh! I know. did you come here to witness my magic?
. . .
Ahh, I see. So you wanna talk to the Captain then right?
.
Abra-kadabra distracto! Fufufu.. And now for my next trick... Invisibility!
.

24
Would you like to battle in the name of science? I'm looking for all the experience I can get!
.
Fascinating! The way you.. and the response of.. and your battle technique, it's incredible!
.

25
Shh, you're distracting me. I'm organizing my team. Oh wait, did you wanna battle?
.
Ack! It's because you inturrupted my strategy.. I'll be more prepared next time!
.

26
I found some spooky little Dokimon I've been dying to test out in battle!
Would you like to spar with me? I feel like I've just finally perfected my strategy!
.
Disappointing, yet, exhilarating! Looks like my strategy needs adjusting..
.


27
Heyo! You wanna battle with me?
I just got a SUPER rare Dokimon from the Captain I've been dying to test out.
I guarantee it's a Dokimon you've never battled against before.. Pleaase please please?
.
Ouch! Looks like I still need to figure out the quirks behind this one!
.

28
I was planning a trip to the beach, but it looks like the paths all blocked up!
Waddaya' say, wanna kill some time with battling with me??
.
Your determination to win in that battle was rock hard!
.

29
I have the cutest team in the whole world! May I show them to you?
.
Yeep! At least we lost in cutesy style..
.

30
I got thrown off course by all these wacky whirlpools!!!
My heads still spinning but I'm never too under the weather to get a battle going!
.
I think I'm gonna be sick..
.

31
I'm gonna let my dragon's wrath out on your Dokimon team!
.
The dragon could not be tamed..
.

32
Not all water type Dokimon live in the water. Care to find out for yourself?
.
Perhaps non-aquatic type Dokimon are better off battling on land..
.

33
Having flying type Dokimon is so convenient, I can fly out to any part of the sea!
.
Oof.. I hope my Dokimon are well enough to fly me back home.
.

34
Having an uncle with a yacht sure comes with it's benefits!
Hey, speaking of which, I've never battled on the water before..
And my uncle recently bought me some fancy new Dokimon, care for a match?
.
No amount of money could hide my embarrassment..
.

35
I'm steaking out the Xer's hideout to make sure they don't do anything funny!
I'm not too busy for a battle though, if you think you can take on a Black Belt Bro!
.
Gasp! I'm gonna have to report this to my Sensei....
.

36
Heyo boya, looking for a battle? I could use a little money~
.
Oh no, my precious dosh!
.

37
Gambling is fun, but I prefer Dokimon battling!
.
I should've sticked to the slots..
.

38
My teams bond is stronger than my Acks Hair Gel!
.
Oof! Maybe I should try a new hair gel brand..
.

39
I snuck into the enemy base!
What? You wanna know what's past this door??
No way! I'm here to get the first scoop on the bad guys!
.
Fine! Have it your way, I'm gonna look for a better scoop..
.

40
I came here looking for tough trainers to sharpen up my skills!
.
Wow, that's sharp!
.

41
The Xer- I mean, my friends sent me her to train because I'm weak..
.
Just as I expected.. I have a lot more training to do.
.

42
Ice monsters are the best! Don't you think so too?
.
Yikes! That's cold as ice!
.

43
I came here to train with my partner, but there sure are some suspicious individuals here!
What do you say, care to spar with me?
.
Quite an intense match! My notes from this battle will become good study material.
.

44
This heat is intense!! Surely, battling here will make my bond with my fire types more powerful!
.
Ack! I came with my heart ablaze, but my opponent came prepared as well!
.

45
Why hello there. My name is Faye! I'm the Ranger and protector of this mountain.
Aki tells me you two need to enter the sacred fairy temple to seek someone out.
Well that's all fine an' dandy! But being the Ranger here, I can't let you through til' you beat me!
Anyway, that's the scoop. Let me know when you're ready to battle.
Are you ready?
.
Wow, your demeanor in battle had me completely mesmerized!
.

46
Looking to kill some time with me on the rocky terrain?
.
Well that came crashing down..
.

47
What's up with you. Itchin' for a fight something??
.
I had it coming, that wasn't very polite of me what I said..
.

48
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.. Prepare for trouble!!
.
"This kids got guts!"/n/"Ouch! That stings.."
.

49
Hmph, not bad for just some kid in a multi-battle..
But don't lump them in with the same group as me. This team is my life's work!
.
My army has failed me... But, a general knows when he's been beat.
.

50
Hehehe, boss taught me a new battle format to get an edge over on the rugrats!
I'll let you be my warm up. What d'ya say, looking to get owned??
.
Boss is liar! That was wayy harder than he made it out to be!
.

51
I won't forget how you embarrassed me.. but it's true, I can see the potential in this.
What d'ya say, wanna spar with me? No hard feelings, I ain't quittin' til I win!
.
Yikes! Ye' got me again... But I can tell I'm getting better at this!
.

52
We're on strict orders to take out anyone that gets near here. Leave now or fight to stay!
.
Come on, let's go home...
.

53
Pump it up to the beat! My team of dragons will take you out in style!
.
Ah man! You totally threw off my groove..
.

54
I've been training~ ♡ Are you up for some doubles?
.
54
Ouch! Double the monsters, double the damage...
.

55
Hey hey, so I hear you're looking for a key?
As if I'd ever tell you!
.
Impossible! My bound monsters lost to the likes of you!?
.

57
I used a "Black Contract" on my my childhood Dokimon and he became super powerful!
He doesn't really like, or remember me... anymore though.
.
Nooo! I closed off your heart for this? I'm not worthy...
.

58
Don't you dare try to steal any of my monsters!
You can't use theft captals in double battles, but I'm only good at singles so...
.
I'll never forgive you for this!
.

60
We will protect the keys with everything we have!
.
Oh no... the keys have fallen into enemy hands...
.

61
You'll never find all 4 keys!
We hid them in the city, in caves, and even in the route nearby.
Besides... You're not gonna have a chance to look for them after I beat you to a pulp!
.
All four!? You beat ALL FOUR of my precious Dokimon!?
.

62
I'm going to revenge my work sis, give me all you've got!
.
Eep! This kids got mad skills...
.

75
The hell? This kids no joke..
.
75
The hell? This kids no joke..
.

76
Aki told me you'd be here...
Technically, you're supposed to challenge me BEFORE you come here.
But I don't see a problem with forcing a challenge onto you to let you leave!
.
76
Aki spoke highly of you. I see now why that is..
.

77
This'll make for a great story! Fancy a match with us?
.
77
"You and that clunky camera!"/n/"Where are you even aiming that mic!?"
.

78
I'm here on escort duty for Ms. Tsuki to make sure her team is in tip top shape.
What, you wanna spar with me or something?
.
78
Just like I practiced at the academy! Well, except for the losing part..
.

79
Why do some Dokimon look like food whilst most look like animals or something?
I don't know the answer, but I like the foody ones. They're cute.
.
79
A battle like that really builds up the ole' appetite!
.

80
Hmm? Who? You're /name/ you say??
Sorry, I don't know anything about what's transpired recently.
I'm resting now but I've been out here taking care of sea monsters and powerful Dokimon for...
I don't even know how long it's been now. Weeks.
I am Elite Ranger Aoi. These seas are particularly dangerous so you need to defeat me to go here.
You won't be able to go this way on that flimsy little surfboard either way though..
But what do you say, do you want battle with me? I'll probably rest here a while longer.
.
80
No fair, the sea monsters wore me out... I had no idea you were strong!
.

81
I'm Azula. You'll need to defeat me if you want to enter Choi's domain.
I'm an Elite Ranger but, I'm also something of a scientist myself, so I'm quite busy..
Do you want to battle? If not, please leave me to my work.
.
81
That was a great battle. Perhaps if I wasn't a scientist I'd have more time to train..
.

82
Hi, I'm Master Choi! If you're looking to get to the ancient village you'll have to beat me.
Feel free to spar with my apprentices as much as you like before the match.
Are you ready to battle?
.
82
Pow! Wow!! You've got a lot of fight in you huh!?
.

83
Yor city is ours! Get out or get down you hear me?
.
83
Yowch! This kid got jiggy with it!
.

84
Face the wrath of a my dragon's rage! Don't you wanna see my dragons in a fiery duel?
.
84
I'm gonna get fired if this keeps up..
.

85
"Yor city belongs to the Xer's!"/n/"Yor city belongs to the Xer's!"
"Think you can beat us Xer twins?"/n/"Think you can beat us Xer twins?"
.
"Yoinks! We were just getting started.."/n/"Yoinks! We were just getting started.."
.

90
Master Choi is watching.. I won't let her down!
.
90
Nooooo, my pride...
.

91
Huh?? Black Belt Bro's? What kinda silly name is that! We're the Choi Choi Chiimu!
.
91
Master Choi will not be happy with this loss... Nor will the fan clubbers!
.

92
Bird power! My little dust ball gremlins won't lose to the likes of you!
.
92
Gaaann! Perhaps our spirit wasn't in the fight..
.

93
How dare you get all chummy with Master Choi! Not even us fan clubbers stoop that low!
.
93
I lacked cheer power... Where's my fan club buddies when I need them?
.

94
Stop right there!!!
We know why you're here.../n/We're not letting you take Tobi! He's our play thing!
.
""Noooooo, now Tobi has to go home...""
.

95
Not so fast mister! We know you're here to save Tobi!
Well, we're not letting that happen! Tobi's our friend! He wants to stay with us!
We're gonna do everything in our power to stop you, bring it on!!!
.
Oh no! We let Master Tobi down...
.

96
We're the last line of defense... We're gonna take you down and save Tobi!
.
Our strategy was too weak, Tobi will never forgive us for this...
.

97
So you've finally come have you...
"Save me?" Save me from what, THIS HEAVEN?
YOU CHASED ALL THE GIRLS AWAY!
Do you understand how hard I had to work as a "Elite Ranger Tobi" in the big City of Xelos??
Do you have any idea what 60 hours a week with no friends, no recognition, and no respect does to a man!?
I was respected here! I didn't have to work! I had it all! And you're here to take that away from me!?
And for what... some silly little Gemstone so you can rescue your friend? So you can fly around?
You are a child and Aki has been foolishly enabling you into your delusions!
I will never... NEVER forgive you for this!!!! GIVE ME WHAT YOU GOT!
.
I-I lost? NO!! Please, please... don't make me go back to that hell...
.

120
"Hello."
"It's great to finally meet your acquantaince."
"We have heard that you have surpassed all of the Elite Rangers before us."
"We are Tenshi. Commander of Dragon type and Fairy Dokimon."
"If you defeat us, you will be granted entrance into our hometown, where we protect people from the Dark one."
"We believe you and Aki refer to him as "Gad'riel", the one who is Magma's father."
"Considering who you will be taking on, there will be no holding back from us."
"Are you ready to fight?"
.
"Aki and Rei have taught you well.. There is no doubt, you can defeat Gad'riel."
.


130
Hey hey it's Marcanine if you know what I mean!
This ought to make for a great video, it's my 2,508th upload! How about a battle?
.
oof! I'll have to edit out the part where I lose.. Quick! Sub to YouTube.com/Marcanine!
.

131
Hello stranger, where did you come from?
It's not often I see unfamiliar faces in my tiny little town! How about a battle?
.
Whoaa! This outsider is super strong!
.

132
You're strong! Like, really really strong!
I'll battle again with you any time. In fact, how about right now?
.
Incredible! I can feel myself getting stronger with each fight!
.

133
I put all my points into one monster so I hope your first Dokimon is prepared!!
.
How could you! My poor Carrotti...
.

134
I have the best swim trunks in the world! The salesman said that, so it must be true!
.
Mr. Salesman sir let me down, these trunks are so totally not cool...
.

135
Shhh! You'll scare the bugs away!
That is, if there was any! I have to make due with grass types...
.
Bug monsters never would've lost! I blame the lazy creator of this cursed world!
.

136
I'm the youngest Elite Battler in the region, Will, and I'm gonna fill my pockets with this one!
I'll never lose to the likes of you, defeating people twice, or even thrive my age is the norm!
.
Noooo! My perfect streak of victories has crumbled like a castle wall...
.

137
Don't even think that I'm gonna lose to the likes of you!
.
Not like this...
.

138
I'm not very strong, and I'm no good at double battles... But I'll give it all I've got!
.
A fruitful yet unsurprising outcome.
.

139
There's not a single thing in that stupid cave! What did I come all the way here for?
Spar with me so I can at least go home with the satisfaction of victory!
.
Yikes, defeated in battle, defeated in spirit...
.

140
You may be a powerful battler, but are you elegant?
.
That wasn't very lady-like of me...
.

141
Too bad for you huh, I've had a bad day so I'll take it out on you!
.
This day just keeps getting worse and worse...
.

142
You'll never be as good as Yumeko, you don't even deserve to face her one on one!
I'll be sure to take you out here before she even has the mispleasure of battling with you!
.
Yumeko-san, I've fallen short of your expectations.
.

143
Yumeko is the greatest! Her double battles are just as enchanting as her twin tails and card magic!
.
Yumeko-san, I've failed you...
.

144
Yawn.. My and Yumeko are best friends... in my dreams.
And in my dreams, I always win at Dokimon battles!
.
Reality is rough... I'm going back to sleep.
.

145
If you want to face Yumeko you'll have to get through me, but I'm not losing to the likes of you!
.
No fair... Oh Yumeko, will you ever forgive me for this blunder?
.

146
Hello. I am Elite Battler Yumeko, the Cultist, and Leader of the Dark Arts Cult!
Defeating me will unlock Koi Cove, an area nearby Lilygrove town.
Do you think you have what it takes to defeat me?
.
My Dark Arts magic has failed me...
.

147
Step aside, I'll use you as a stepping stool to my next level!
.
How am I supposed to level up if I just keep losing...
.

148
Why hello there ♡ care to show me what you've got?
.
No fair... You knew just how strong you were before accepting my challenge!
.

149
Hey! You have any idea on how to get out of here??
I was just trying to train and I got completely lost here...
Oh? You're a challenger? Well, that doesn't really help my situation but... sure!
I'm Elite Battler Ai, the Spirit Whisperer. If you win, can you take me back home? Please?
.
Yayy, now get me out of this place! It's dark, and the voices are louder here..
.

150
A-a challenger! Y-you're in for a S-spook!
.
S-something something boo... I-I mean, aw nevermind...
.

151
Yawn... Let's make this quick, I have a meeting with my bed at 5.
.
Aw man, I'm gonna be late for my meeting...
.

152
I hope you're prepared for my super lovey dovey team of destiny.
Don't you know? Love is WAR baby! Let's get ultra romantic ♡
.
Hmph, I see you're playing hard to get... But I'm not giving up!
.

153
You dare challenge ME!? Why, what a terrible fate you've brought upon yourself!
.
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead...
.

154
Ara ara~ Who could this be?
Ah, a challenger hmm? I'm Elite Battler Momoka. Let's battle lots and lots ♡
.
Hmm~ Not bad for a kid ♡ maybe I'll see you around.
.

155
Back for more, huh? Hmph, I'll humor you...
.
Impossible!! I'm not falling for your dirty tricks again, let's do a do-over!
.

156
I knew you were hungry for more... Don't think I'm taking it easy on you this time!
.
Oh this is just depressing... I can't even use my powers in such a noisy place!
.

157
Wow, this place is WAY better than that stinky ole' cave...
I'm fired up! How about a practice match? We can battle as much as you want ♡
.
Inspiring! Let's go again... I'll go heal up right away!
.

158
I am Elite Battler Lee.
Before I became a Battler, I spent countless years mastering the blade.
Now, I spend my days training my Dokimon, as well as young whippersnappers in various arts.
What do you say, will you battle with this old man?
.
Each day is filled with lessons, but the untrained mind will only see obstacles.
