Whoa! You have a Dokimon with you?? Be careful, those things are dangerous!
Well, this one's kind of cute actually, I guess..
Just be careful!! The cute ones are some of the most dangerous..
.

2
You kids need to be sure to stay away from that forest, wannabe Ranger or not.
It's a small, close-knit town. Can't have anyone else go missing ever again..
.


3
Sorry kid, this path is currently blocked off so you'll have to wait. Only residents are allowed in.
.

4
Professor Rei's discoveries are a breakthrough! The way she thinks, it's just, it's just..
Genius !!
.

5
Oh, hey there. Did you need something? Oh? Huh? Sure, I'll heal your monsters for you, just oooone second..
....
There you go, all patched up. Stay safe out there!
.

6
This restaurant is super tasty!!
But, because of that sometimes the wait is really long..
.

7
Man, that hits the spot! I'm feeling charged up and ready to battle after a meal like that!
.

8
Hey /name/! Thanks for being friends with my chatty daughter Koi.
I don't know how you kids keep up with her. She just about drives me crazy with her stories sometimes!
.

9
Despite the mysteries that shroud this town, I always found the quiet peaceful.
It's a shame what happened to that young girl all those years ago though..
.

10
Huh? How did you get in here?
You better watch your back around here, these parts are Xer's territory now!
.

11
I've been itching for a fight.. but boss says I have to wait until phase 2 of the plan...
.


12
My Kitsu here is incredible, she can morph into so many different forms!
100 years ago you'd never believe shape shifting aliens would come try to take over our world.
And even less so that we'd come to be able to befriend then!
Well.. some of them.
.

13
Nope. No bug Dokimon here, I've searched everywhere...
.

14
Yo! Whoa there, you scared me.. Can't you see I'm busy?
I'm investigating an important case here!
.

15
My friends were supposed to meet me at this arcade, but they're running quite late...
I wonder what could be keeping them.
.

16
Living in this giant city is so expensive!
I think I'm gonna move out to a nice, quiet farm town..
.

19
These orbs... They're, they're genius!
When we combine these with multiple party members...
We're able to split the experience between all of them.
It's genius! Truly, X-Tech has come so far.
Wait, who were you again?
.

20
Have you seen the latest data on the Yuujyou Orb's field tests?
.

21
Yes, it's astounding! The efficiency of experience transfer is beyond our wildest dreams!
.

22
Whew. Is it just me? or is it HOT in here. I swear this floor is hotter than the other ones.
.

23
Whoa, what! Who goes there? No I wasn't playing games again!
It's this third monitor, it has a mind of it's own!
.


24
WA HA HA!
Is this the little squirt that's been running around bothering my crew?
WA HA HA! You sure gave them a headache! I was wondering when the protagonist would arrive.
Glad to have ya skippy! Hope this livens things up. It was too boring when things were going so well!
WA HA HA HA!
.

25
Whatever you do, don't ask the professor about her erm.. living situations.
Let's just say, she gets a little uhh.... cranky..
.

26
She's using a CHAIR as a table, A CHAIR!!!
Meanwhile, I can't even get to my computer. Oh what happened to our great professor..
.

27
Hey hun! Need a break?
Sure sure! Just take a rest here and you'll feel better.
...
.....
Oh, leaving already? Well, alright then. Be safe out there!
.

28
Hello dear! Thank you for visiting our business.
Unfortunately we're not quite open to new customers yet, but feel free to look around.
If you have any questions, considering having a chat with the care takers outside.
.

29
I hate that stupid microwave!! If it was up to me, I'd be tearing it out of the ceiling right now, bad back and all!
.

30
Heyo! Sorry hun, you'll have to defeat Haru if you wanna pass through this cave system.
He's the little yellow fellow that travels around these parts, I'm sure you've seen him before.
Anyways, go find him if you wanna pass through!
.

31
Nom nom.. Ice cream on the job is even better than ice cream at home!
.

32
There's a couple here that runs a little day care type thing for Dokimon.
I actually live a town over, but they've sure saved me a few times!
My little Casper is such a rascal, sometimes I just need a break from his shenanigans.
.

33
The inn here in town is such a life saver. My Dokimon and I can take it easy there after a long work day.
.

34
Shh!! You'll scare the Dokimon. Awww, that one's so cute.
.

35
I forgot my key again, I'm waiting for my wife to get home so I can go inside...
.

36
That Haru sure loves fish, fishing, and Flounder! I mean, have you SEEN this house?
Between him and the professor, this town sure has it's fair share of eccentrics!
Haru's a great guy though. He's a Guardian Ranger, and he gave me a free fishing rod too!
.

37
Whoa!!!
Did you see that! Did you see?
Someone just went zooming by on a surfboard.
I think a Dokimon was on the back of it, paddling suuuuper fast.
That's so cool! I wish I was old enough to have Dokimon.
.

38
The sound of the beach waves always calms me down, but somethings different about today.
I don't know, I just feel like I'm being... watched. Maybe I'm going crazy.
.

39
I left my Dokimon with these elders above me, and when I came back my Dokimon evolved..
Not sure how I feel about it. Sure, he's stronger now, but he was much cuter before..
.

40
My Dokimon leveled up and learned a super strong new move!!
Or, at least I thought he did. It turned out to be pretty weak..
But thankfully, Dokimon are smart, and can easily re-learn their old moves.
So she was back to full strength in a jiffy!
.

41
Not much going on around here recently.
I do wonder where that Ranger of our town went off to recently though.
.

42
I don't believe it, my master set me up to FAIL! He KNEW I wouldn't be able to do that!
.

43
There is no shame in failure.. In fact it is quite the opposite.
Failure IS success. What accomplishment is there in that which you can already do now?
.

44
I fooled one! I actually fooled one this time!! Master will be so proud of me!
.

45
Hate to break it to you, but I am not indeed the Elite Trainer you seek.
You'll have to venture further into the shrine if you wish to face her, she's just past me and my twin sister.
.

46
S-s-s-sorry to lie to you... It's s-something my sisters came up with a long time ago..
A-actually, we're quintuplets so, you should find my oldest sister next.
B-but I have to warn you, she's m-much stronger than the likes of us!! Especially me..
.

47
You did well to beat me! With this no one will stop you from heading out to sea.
But how you go about that is another story.. Though, I did hear about a surfboard event North of Coralwood.
Perhaps you should go check it out, there's a town you can reach by sea not far from Coralwood.
It's a mysterious town so maybe you can find some clues about your lost friend there?
.

48
Master Aki is kind of scary.. Recently she's been saying her sisters aren't enough to defend the shrine.
And so a few of us have been forced to dress up and do make-up like her, and then there's the acting classes..
.

49
Master Aki's skills are unparalleled! Whenever I get hung up in my investigation work, I come to see her.
Her clairvoyance fee is ridiculous though! I can only afford it when I'm on an especially big case.
.

50
I got kicked off the Xer's team for being a big dunce..
They paid Master Aki to delete some of my memories to protect their secrets, but I think she did too much!
.

51
I'm here to talk to the shrine Master to say a prayer and help my late mother rest in peace.
But oh! I just can't remember her name.. Master Ha- Master A- no no no, oh what was it!
.

52
The shrine Master here is world famous, she's like, SUPER powerful! I think I saw her on TV before.
Some people say she's wasting time being an Elite Ranger, but personally I'm not so sure..
I asked her about it once, and she mentioned guiding fledgeling Dokimon Rangers is extremely important to her.
I guess it is true that a lot of people disappear due to Dokimon attacks, not that I have any experience with that.
.

53
Four? I remember it being five, but perhaps I'm just getting old.
.

54
On TV I saw that one in five people have been attacked or abducted by Dokimon in the past 5 years.
I don't know, I think that's just a rumor.
.

55
Nothing beats a day in the garden!
Well, except having hair. Ahahahah! But no, hair never sent beautiful butterflies my way every day.
.

56
Books make you smart!
If only I could read.
.


57
The dude that lives next to me is a real prick! Always playing loud music.
But I can't complain to him because he's the only one who showed up to my birthday last year...
He even gave me a plushie of my favorite Dokimon.
.

58
This is it, this is the life! I was finally able to move out on my own to a quiet little town.
Yes sir, this here is the fruits of my labor. Now I can finally catch up on those Draven Quest games!
.

59
Hello, are you here to take a rest?
Of course, sure thing. Go ahead and lay down as much as you need. You'll feel better in a jiffy!
...
.....
Oh, leaving already? Well, alright then. Be safe out there!
.

60
Our beloved Elite Ranger doesn't usually hang out around town anymore. 
She has a peaceful little place at the shrine just north of here.
If you head north and then left just before the rocky terrain you'll find where she stays.
.

61
If you're looking for the Shrine Master or Elite Ranger her shrine is left from here.
.

62
Some darn'd Dokimon came and put these giant logs here!
It was the craziest thing I ever saw. I swear the thing had it out for me.
It was stalking me all week, and then one night I heard creepy laughing and scraping all night long.
And it turns out it was just laughing it's head off while blocking me in!!
How am I supposed to visit my grand daughter now.. I reached out to the Shrine Master, but she's a busy bee!
.

63
Hey I see you got a fancy new surfboard there! Do you know how to use it?
Basically, all you have to do is run off a deck real fast! 
And before you know it, you'll be surfing afloat the water. Cool huh?
.

64
I love shorts! They're so comfy and easy to wear on the beach.
It's a little toasty with this hat on though.
.

65
The Elite Ranger that defends our town is super finicky about who and where she battles.
Last time someone wanted to challenge her, they made them find her out at sea and battle her there.
It's a bit cruel if you ask me, considering she uses water affiliate Dokimon, she has a big advantage.
.

66
I spent all my money on stuffed animals so I couldn't afford any furniture or kitchen utilities..
All I have is this small table I found outside, I buy all my food from the convenience store.
.

67
I love books!!
..Oh, excuse the clothes, I'm about to go to work.
.

68
Nothing like some refreshing Tea on a hot day!/n/Wait, how did you get in here?
.

69

.

70
Shhh, I'm trying to concentrate!
My grandfather once shattered one of these boulders with his bare fists!
But all I get is bloody knuckles..
.

71
I'm cosplaying as the Black Belt Bros!
WHAT!? You don't know them!? They're famous!!! They can straight punch a tree down for it's wood.
Heck, they might even be able to split a boulder!
If you wanna know more about them, you should go to the Black Belt Fan Club in the house just above me.
.

72
The Black Belt Bros are so cool! They live on a nearby island so they visit here all the time.
.

73
If you take to the seas, head South for a bit, and then East, you'll end up at the Black Belt Bros hometown!
I've never been though, I'm just a fan. Those waters are littered with dangerous Dokimon, eep!
If it wasn't for my trusty buddy here, I don't know how I'd get by.
.

74
The Black Belt Bros helped me get out of a bad situation with the Xer's.
I was one of their go boys for a little while..
But one day, when the Black Belt Bros were storming one of their bases, I reached out to them.
Ever since that day I've been free! That organization is filled with lunatics, not my cup of tea..
.

75
The Black Belt Bros' Fan Club also serves as a public service.
If you ever need a place to rest, you can come by here any time.
In fact.. You're looking kind of tired already, how about you take a rest?
.

76
Don't let the appearance of any of these guys scare you.
They're all a bunch of softies just mimicking what they see on TV. They WISH they were as cool as they act!
.

77
Yes yes finally! It finally came. There's nothing better than a Western Bed I tell ya!
Everyone told me "Don't get that thing, it's too big! That's too much bed for one person to handle!"
But look at me now, I have the biggest bed around, muahaha!
....
It do be kinda big though huh.. almost makes the rest of the room look kinda small.
.

78
Hey! That's not fair, give me that back! Who said you can take my card? That's not how prize cards work!!
.

79
Hehehe, who ever said we were playing by official rules? Your Raptor is mine!
.

80
It's not easy having two rug rats for twins, especially in a house as small as this one..
.

81
I can hear those two argue all the way over here.. Have they no idea how LOUD they are!?
.

82
This house needs some serious rearranging.. Who puts a mirror in front of a window??
And on top of that, it's next to a cactus! I keep poking myself..
.

83
If it wasn't for the Black Belt Bros frequently visiting these parts, I don't know if we could live here.
The rent is insane on the beach! But you can't beat walking out to the sound of the waves in the morning.
But rent on the island is much, much more. In fact, it's almost double!
.

84
Hello. If you'd like to order please use the screen in front. Thank you.
.

85
Two more please!
Wait, you don't work here do you? Where's your fancy blue outfit!
.

86
I've been going out to Sea every day searching for an Elite Ranger that stays around here.
But I get sea sick easily, so it's taking forever..
Beating her will get me one step closer to overcoming my sea sickness! Then, I can finally go on that cruise.
.

87
Aw man, you just missed it! There was just an epic battle on the waves.
It was like BOOM! And then WHAM! and then, and then BOOSH!
.

88
Hiyo! If you're looking for Aoi she's out on some super important mission with the Black Belt Bro's!
I heard she's on their island fighting some XYZ fellows or something like that.
I hope she brings me back a neat souvenir from 
.

89
Hiya! Are you coming to challenge Aki to a battle too?
Wow, your Dokimon look really strong! You'll definitely be able to get a free blessing from her.
...
What!? You didn't know that Aki gives out a free blessing to challengers that are able to beat her!?
Yeah! That's like, half the point of battling her! Unless you're an adventurer, I guess.
Aki's fee is insane! But I don't think it's out of greed, otherwise she wouldn't give out freebies.
She's famous worldwide, and would never get any free time to herself if she was humble with her pricing.
Anyway, I was just having a pep talk with my Dokimon team. I'm gonna ask for the winning lottery numbers!
.

90
SIR, SIR. HE'S GOT A GEEK BAR! A REAL ONE!!
.

91
NO I DON'T! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS, SERIOUS!
.

92
Goofy kid. He doesn't even know what an inhaler looks like!
.

93
Hello, looks like I'm on egg duty today. You can leave Monster Eggs here if you'd like for them to hatch.
This Egg Patch Field is right next to the ocean too, I wonder if the sound of the waves calms them.
.

94
Whoa, another surfing Dokimon Ranger??
Sheeesh, surfs up duude.
.

95
Button mashing cheapskate!!!! What kind of battle plan is that!? Huh?
.

96
I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's funny when he gets angry.
.

97
Progress on the cave system is looking great! We've gone from a 2 bed 1 bath, to a small city in days!
The power of Dokimon is more than we ever imagined, who knew they were capable of such feats!
Wait, who are you again?
.

98
Whoa there pal, you know the rules. No passage before entering in the passcode, no more free passes.
Not after that Black Belter snuck in here wearing make shift Xer clothes.. I swear, that guy was a social engineer.
.

99
Hey /name/, did you find my sailor friend yet?
Remember, we need an Xer outfit made, and you can find my friend on these waters, just West from this island.
He's the captain, and he'll definitely comply once you mention knitting.
Don't worry, I'm working with the Black Belt Bros on cracking this passcode, so you just worry about that outfit!
.

100
Black Belt Bros, at your service!
.

101
Ay' mate lost as sea are ye'? At' thing don't look vry' stable, how yer' balance on ar'??
.

102
Mate, I already told you to quit talking like that. You were raised in Florida, not Tortuga.
Ignore him, he thinks he's gonna become some famous sailor feared by all in the Seven Seas.
..Even though he's 45 and still lives with the Cap'..
.

103
No better way to enjoy your day off than a warm cup o' Joe!
Hey, you know what? Since I'm such a nice guy, why don't you try some too!
Here, drink up!
.

104
Shhhh!! I'm trying to look busy over here..
.

105
Ummmm, am I the only one who's wondering how this ship hasn't sunk yet??
Like, just look at the place. There's holes everywhere!
There's more holes here than in the story of Go Stories' English Dub!
.

106
Hey, what did you forget your outfit??
That's fine, just don't let any commanders see you like that or you'll be finished!
Oh, you needed your team healed up?? Sure, I got you. Just a sec. . .
And there you go! Best of luck out in the field solider!
.

107
Oi' mate, don't ye be botherin' the cap'n y'here!
I'm on look out duty terday' and I ain't nothin' by me.
.

108
Listen kiddo don't be throwin' threats around like that no more y'here?
Tellin' ya, if it wasn't a request from an ole friend I'd of left ya to the mercy of the crew!
Ar ar ar.
.

109
People make fun of me, and my blue house.
They say I'm blue. And they say, "What's wrong with your house? Grow up!"
But you know what? That's ok.
I don't live for them. I have my own life, my own skills, ambitions, and things that I like.
.

110
Fishing can be relaxing, but it takes patience to catch something rare.
.

111
Hey! You're not supposed to come back here you know..
.

112
There is peace to those that are happy with few!
Oh, were you looking for Aoi?
She's out fighting some giant monster out at sea! I don't think she'll be back any time soon.
.

113
I hope you weren't planning on crossing these here waters with that flimsy thing were you?
That would be madness! No no, you would need a proper boat or water craft to go through here.
.

114
Black Belt Bro's are on duty!
If you see any of those pesky Xer's running around causing havoc in town, let me know!
.

115
Black Belt Bro's are nothing but muscles for brains!
.

116
Oh yeah, oh yeah!? Well, your outfit is stupid. And your group name makes no sense!
.

117
Look, I get she's supposed to be some rich, world famous sage...
But did she REALLY have to go off and build an entire shrine just for herself on our island!?
.

118
Someone that just swam by tried scaring me with scary sea monster stories.
It's kinda working...
.

119
...do you mind.... you're scaring the fish..
.

120
Shhh! I'm on the lookout for rare water type Dokimon to add to my collection!
.

121
It's such a joy to be able to come out and enjoy the water!
.

122
Even Black Belt Bro's members like to enjoy the deep blue sea!
.

123
I'm patrolling the seas! Currently I'm investigating this pirate ship over there..
Can't be too careful, some rowdy group just tried taking over our island after all!
.

124
...and then I said, "what color is your yacht?" HAHAHAHAHA
.

125
This old dude sure likes to brag..
.

126
Blehhh another day on the boat. I'd rather be at home playing my Pen S..
.

127
I get these Xer dudes are supposed to be all super evil and stuff..
But can't they be evil a little more quieter?? I can't sleep with all their racket..
.

128
What, you looking to take over my shift or somethin'?
.

129
Having a convenience store right in the base is genius!
But man, they sure tax you on the price of everything.
.

130
I tried Dokimon battling to make money and support my family, but I wasn't good at it..
Working in a bunny suit every day isn't always fun, but it beats getting all banged up!
.

131
It's genius! The biomagenerator is capable of incredible things!
With this, we can potentially replicate any biome, and house happy Dokimon in them!
Huh? Why does it look like a rock? Why, because we disguised it like that of course!
What? Why did we need to disguise it if we only need these for our hidden bases?
Well.. Actually, I don't know if I have the answer to that.
Wait, why did we go through the trouble of disguising these like this...
.

132
Isn't it just fascinating! Who knew we would be able to replicate Dokimon's habitat.
With this, we're able to house Dokimon and keep them nearly as satisfied as they are in the wild!
.

133
Uff.. Lava data is the worst, I can feel my organs melting in real time.
I should've never told that officer my favorite type was fire types...
.

134
Watching from afar is quite interesting, but getting up close and personal can be fun too!
Especially with gentle water type Dokimon, these guys are usually decently docile.
.

135
Being wet in a lab coat isn't exactly thrilling, but it could be a lot worse.. Heh.
.

136
It's marvelous! To think we'd even be able to unlock teleportation.
Dokimon and the Xer's power are unstoppable! Combined, we can accomplish the unthinkable!
.

137
It's marvelous! To think we'd even be able to unlock teleportation.
Dokimon and the Xer's power are unstoppable! Combined, we can accomplish the unthinkable!
.

138
Hmm? What's wrong rookie, you having a bit of trouble figuring it out?
Just illuminate the entire teleportation board in time and it'll zap you right over!
.

139
Long way down... Best not get near.
.

140
These readings are extraordinary, why, they're over 9000! But, they're quickly depleting..
The target must be leaving at incredible speed. Shoot, we just missed it...
.

141
Huh!? What are you looking at punk?
Wait, don't tell me you came into this forest with nothing but a puny Whispurr??
Ha! You better hope you don't run into any Dokimon in here with that thing!
.

142
How did you get up here?
.

143
Being in the Black Belt Bros. is cool and all, but you know what's not cool?
Being distant with your folks. When's the last time you gave your Mom a visit?
.

144
Jeez, there you are. You're finally awake! Do you have any idea how long you slept!?
3 days! Do you know how valuable THREE DAYS is to someone like me!? You can put no price to it!
Hmph. No matter. I told you I would help you, therefore I will see it until the end.
Anyway, hurry up. The picture of your friend is getting clearer, but it's still murky.
I have to use my power at the top of this mountain to maximize my powers and get the full picture.
So get to it, I'm not getting any younger! I'll meet you at the top.
.

145
There's rumors that there's an entire ancient civilization on top of the mountain behind this town.
As if anyone would believe that, ha!
.

146
This town is famous amongst Dokimon Rangers.
They come here to test their strength in the mountains, and encounter various new partners.
It's been rather quiet though recently, I wonder if it's because of that..
.

147
I came all this way to train on the mountain on this island and there's nobody here!
So what, a party of 4 or 5 people trekked up the mountain and never came back.
For all we know they're laughing at us through binoculars eatin' smores!
.

148
I'm out house shopping. The real estate here is crazy low all of a sudden!
.

149
Stand back. This Laboratory is currently under investigation for negligance.
.

150
Yo, sorry kid. The Lab's under investigation so you can't enter.
.

151
Business has been rough kid. All our inventory is rotting out before we can even sell it..
Unfortunately gonna have to close down shop until the island picks up again.
.

152
I'm still moving in. You won't believe it, I got this place for a steal!
.

153
Hey there, traveler. Are you resting up from training here too?
I've been at this inn for almost 3 days now, me and my team were exhausted!
.

154
I moved all the way out to the mountains to die alone, but look at this place!
Who know this mountain would turn out to become such a happenin' place amongst all the youngins'..
.

155
I'm not old enough to be a Ranger yet so I'm just watching my Dad battle to learn from the sidelines!
.

156
This tree is famous for it's alluring aroma, and the calming aura it provides.
I come here to meditate every morning before starting my day.
.

157
All this stress and effort to get to the top of this mountain and there's not even an onsen..
Not to mention the nightmares I'm gonna have for the next two weeks.
Ahh.. I'd really love to be soaking my feet in the hot tub on my yacht about now..
.

158
If you pray for beautiful flowers to bloom in your yard, don't be surprised when a storm comes raining down.
Likewise, if you pray for strength, patience, and blessings, be thankful when challenges come your way.
.

159
Sorry kid, no entry.
.

160
You heard the nice lady.
.

161
This town is filled to the brim with beautiful fairies and fairy type Dokimon.
Unless your family has lived here for generations, you need a special item to be able to see them though.
But as far as anyone knows, all those relics were destroyed long ago by a samurai.
The legend says that he was granted long life because of his exposure to fairy dust.
But because of that, he had to watch everyone he knew die. Including his children, and their children.
So, he sought out to destroy all of them to make sure no one else suffered the same fate.
.

162
This town has one of the lowest birthrates out of any of them in the entire world.
But it's due to the curse of the fairy dust.
By the time you're of child bearing age, the dust's magic makes it nearly impossible to have kids.
That is, if you live here that entire time.
But the other effect of the fairy dust is that we get to live much longer than the normal person.
That's why this town is so heavily protected and concealed, to ensure no bad guys try to take over.
.

163
I'm STARVING! A man's gotta EAT you know what I mean?
.

164

.

165
So uhhh...
Needless to say but I think this is FAR from what both of us were expecting..
But anyway, we didn't come here to go skinny dipping. After you, Zippy.
".....Did she just call me Zippy!?"
. . .
.

166
I can't believe it, the Surfboard vendor came to our little town!
This is a huge event, hardly anything ever happens here after all..
.

167
I'm so excited that the Surfboard vendor came to our town!
I'm still trying to figure out what color I'm gonna get..
Huh? You didn't know? They're set up on the beach North from here, check em' out!
.

168
I heard the Surfboard vendor showed up in the next town over!
But I can't go because the caves are guarded by Rangers, and I have no Dokimon..
I hope they come to my town too some day!
.

169
I'm standing guard.
This town is surrounded by super powerful Dokimon so we have to be on a sharp lookout.
.

170
Never sneak up on a Knight guarding their castle.
This town gets attacked extremely frequently, so we're constantly on edge.
Making the wrong move around us could end up with a Katana slash to the knee, or worse..
.

171
My shift is over and this is my home, but I don't fit through the doorway with the armor on..
Maybe I should have someone widen the doorway....
.

172
Welcome to Gad'riels Peak. Take caution for Dokimon attacks during your stay.
.

173
Shh!!! I could've SWORN I just saw some movement over there!
This place gives me the creeps. I swear, I've started seeing things since I picked up this job.
.

174
I've been training to be able to break this rock wide open!
But no matter how hard I train, nothing seems to work..
Not even my mighty sword can slash through this measly stone!
.

175
It takes years to master the ability of rock splitting.
There are no shortcuts in life, nor in the art of splitting rocks.
He who is on the wrong path will stumble and fall, but a focused mind can pierce through stone.
.

176
I'd stop right there if I were you...
This side of the Mountain is known to be the worst.
There monsters are particularly strong, the trees are winding this way and that way.
And you might suddenly find yourself in a cave!
More people have disapeared here than any other part of the mountain.
I don't think there's even a single person on this side but you and me!
.

177
Did you know you can turn to face your Dokimon and chat with them?
My Luna doesn't talk much, but you can tell she's blushing sometimes when I baby her.
It's so cute!
.

178
So uhhh... What are we supposed to do now?
.

179
I DON'T KNOW, KAREN! I'VE NEVER BEEN FORGOTTEN AFTER AN EMERGENCY AIR LIFT BEFORE!!
.

180
Sorry kid. No exit or entry to this island for the time being.
If you wanna leave it's gonna have to be tomorrow. I believe the inn has vacancy.
.

181
This is my favorite little spot on the whole island!
It's even better now that no one is here. Usually this tiny island is crowded!
.

182
It's a whole lot easier to fish when the waters aren't crowded with tourists!
.

183
I'm enjoying the big open sea.
Last month it was almost completely packed with tourists over some surf campaign.
.

184
Be careful in that swirly bit up there! I almost got trapped..
.

185
I hope my partner can't see me out here enjoying the waves instead of at my post..
.

186
People will lie to you, some as naturally as they breathe.
This is an unfortunate truth of humankind.
But perhaps more frequent, and more unfortunate than that,
your own flesh and blood will turn against you, and lie to you just the same.
Ask yourself, are you in control of the vessel that carries you from place to place?
Or do you let your flesh thrash you around, whilst you sit idle in the command center?
.

187
Hmm?
Ah! Why if it isn't one of Rei's disciples! I was wondering when you all would make it here.
Rei is quite the piece of work. I have the biggest Lab in all of Xelos, yet we can't keep up with her!
Did you know? We professor's like to joke that she has her lab helpers just for the good company!
She's truly a phenomena in Dokimon research and no one can hold a candle to her.
Oh, this little guy? Yeah, we were butting heads back at Passaway Caves but ended up teaming up, ha!
.

188
Never a dull day with Professor Rook around! He keeps us on track and excited to uncover new things.
.

189
Huh? Professor Rook's first name??
I'm not sure.. it's not like we use it around here. But I think it started with a C maybe?
.

190
I have no idea how I was able to convince the professor to let me have three monitors but...
but man it was worth it. This is so freaking sweet! I can never go back.
.

191
I'm analyzing data from a team expedition into the depths of a volcano!
It was nuts, we had like, some super strong Rangers there to protect us!
.

192
I'm taking my break.
Nothing beats some warm tea and a wash cloth over your eyes after 11 hours straight on the computer!
.

193
I've been put on nurse duty and sorting papers for two weeks...
Oh, I mean.. Yeah, let me take these guys from you for a moment.
. . .
There you go, all healed up!
.

194
I can't stand this place and I work here for goodness sake!!
It's like I'm in the backrooms. I get lost every time, what is it about this place anyway!?
.

195
I can finally go home tomorrow!
.

196
The children are out playing with their caregiver.
.

197
Her status is critical but we have the best people in the world here for her.
Though, I don't think there's any possibility of her leaving her with both of her eyes..
.

198
must..... sleeep..........
.

199
Your friend is in good hands. The gash scraped her skull and got very close to her brain but..
Everything is mostly in-tact. At best, she'll be out of her in a few weeks with one good eye.
We're doing everything we can for her.
.

200
This place was a hell of a lot cooler when it was some old dude and it was nothing but retro games.
Now, half of those are gone and have been replaced with slot games for crappy kiddy prizes.
I think this is all a ploy to get kids into the slot addiction as a casino also opened up nearby..
This use to be a chill place some old man spent his life collecting and building.
It only took a short few months of his passing for an old man's dream to be trampled over by greed..
.

201
Thank you for your patronage! Please enjoy your stay here.
If you're looking for adult beverages please check out the retro corner in our partner store!
.

202
Thank you for your patronage!
Let me know if there's any machines you took an interest in... let's play together! Teehee.
.

203
Whatever they pay these girls it's not enough..
.

204
Holy crap I'm straight crud at this game! I hope the customer doesn't notice, or mind...
.

205
どうぞ おはいりくださいませ ♡ いっしょに ゲームを あそんで いただけませんか？
.

206
わーイケメン！ ♡ みなで あそんで いただけたら きっと よろこびますよ！
.

207
Hello sir, welcome to the VIP section. Please have a chat with one of the girls if you're interested.
.

208
Drat, those bastards really got me this time!
I have no idea what those girls outside said, but it piqued my interest just enough to suck me inside.
.

209
O-oh my! Why if it isn't /name/...
Uhh, how about we just pretend you didn't see me here? There's just uhh, some fish game I really like...
*You take a glance at what kind of game Haru is playing and.... There are no fish here.*
.

210
Technology is something else huh. To think they'd have such a large array of games on just one machine!
.

211
The cost to play together with someone is a necessary expense!
All my scientist buddies couldn't care less about gaming.
.

212
Chatting and playing games with the customers is always a blast ♡
.

213
Uhh, I don't think you're supposed to be back here..
.

214
Uhg, what a drag. I've worked 6 days in a row! I'm not covering for that girl ever again!
.

215
Xer's are the future of the universe! Once we take over Xelos city nothing will be able to stop us!
.

216
I don't really believe all the rumors about all of the weirdly dressed people I work with.
I mean, come on. They say some silly things, but take over the city and monopolize the power industry?
Either they're just joking around or they're talking about some silly video game.
.

217
Everyone with the weird X logo on their shirts talk funny. Must be some kinda video game club.
.

218
One of the guys I work with was talking about all these different colored keys they have in the city.
I don't know what that's supposed to be code for but he seemed dead serious when he said it.
.

219
I don't get it! How did a spy get in? And if not a spy.. How! Who's leaking all of our secrets!?
.

220
Sir, it appears there's been a major breach in information ever since we opened this store.
The people of Xelos city still seem to believe the stories about us are just rumors, however..
Some of our real plans and safety measures have also been heard in conversations, mixed in with the lies.
.

221
Hehehe, kidnapping Ranger Tobi to stop the flow of travel between Rangers was genius if I may say..
.

222
Indeed indeed! A marvelous plan indeed.. With this, we'll soon be able to move operation escort into play!
.

223
There's rumors that some bad people did something to Master Tobi and are preventing Rangers from finding him..
I don't get what it's about though, something about charging to escort people to dangerous areas instead?
There's even some people saying that those bad guys might suddenly turn on you and steal your Dokimon!
But surely no one would be evil enough to do something like that!
.

224
My precious Dokimon got stolen but no one believes me.. They think I'm just begging for attention!
These guys promised to safely escort me to the next town over, but they suddenly jumped me!
.

225
I think I've just about lost my mind!
No matter how many times I asked those girls what they said to me I couldn't understand a word.
Maybe I should go get my head checked..
.

226
There used to be a bustling flight school in this town, but since Tobi got busy there hasn't been many classes.
.

227
The Xer's control of information is phenomenal! Not the great Xelos City is can escape our reign!
To think the biggest city in the land thinks all the rumors about "the power company" are just made up.
Meanwhile, we can test out our equipment and strategies in all the small towns that we want!
.

228
It's too bad about Xer Island, but this city is the real prize. Control the population and you control everything!
.

229
What's going on? I could've sworn I parked here!
.

230
Don't be fooled by her.. She might go by Lily, but her real name is Lilith.
She is an unkillable monster in human clothing.
.

231
There's some weird tile in this lab that always drives me crazy!
It's so out of the ordinary.. and doesn't match the rest. It just randomly appeared one day!
I mean, ahh.. Nevermind, I can't be worried about that. I have important work to do!
.

232
Wow, cool! Your D-Tech is filled up with lots of fun monsters.
I can tell you've been on lots of adventures with your team.
Did you know? When you catch Dokimon you learn a little more about them than you did before.
Hey, I have a good idea. How about you show me 30 caught monsters and I'll give you a present!
Great! Can't wait to see it. I have a business trip coming up soon though, so sooner the better!
.

233
I heard some people can battle with two Dokimon at the same time!
But surely that's just some silly rumor.
.

234
Hiya! Looking for professor Rei?
Hmm, she's not in right now. She said something about some important mission.
I'm just looking after this little one, but I can't imagine her being gone tooooo long.
.

235
Tenshou Tower is currently under tight security due to Xer shenanigans. Elite Rangers only.
.

236
Are these bozo's really tryna cave shenanigans again???
I heard last time they tried some smut like that they got chased out by some real top dogs!
Rumors say even Aki showed up there, but some people are saying Xer's got revenge and took her out.
I don't know what's true but.. I haven't seen Aki on TV recently, and she's not at the shrine.
I hope she's ok.. She's one of the only lights in this dark world. People really flock to her.
.

237
I never knew there was an area behind this shrine (behind where Aki stands) until yesterday.
Even though I've been coming here my whole life! But apparently it's kind of a secret.
It's a little sad actually.. I guess hurt or abandoned Dokimon gather there occasionally..
Like, I get why most people hate Dokimon but.. Come on! We've come to understand it's a minority.
Most of them are good! Right? Or maybe that's just because we've domesticated them? I don't know..
.

238
It's rare to have visitors back here. Please, take your time.
.

239
The Ranch keeper recently got separated with her precious Dokimon she's had since she was young..
Because of that, we're operating at half capacity while most of the staff is on a search party.
But once she comes back we'll be able to return to normal business hours and operations!
When that happens, please come visit us again and explore our options or rare Dokimon hatchlings!
.

240
Yeah yeah yeah kid. Look, you know I'm busy. Whatever you wanna buy, it's on the computer.
.

241
I heard there's some nefarious group that does terrible experiments on Dokimon!
And sometimes those monsters will go completely berserk, or close their heart off forever.
.

242
It feels good to soak your feet in the water every once in a while!
I needed a break from all the battling after all.
.

243
Shh! No time to talk.. Work only!!
.

244
Cut it out kid! I'm focusing on a battle!
.

245
We got your back /name/.. We're in this together!
Get to Aki. Hurry!
.

246
BLAAACK BEEEELT POWERRRRRR !!!!!!
.

247
Master is inside. Maybe it's not easy to tell but you can walk inside to my right.
.

248
The art of rock splitting is no small task! But I'm not quitting til I figure it out..
.

249
Jeez! That stinkin' detective is investigating the lab again... Right when I need to go inside!
I mean whoa! What? Who are you?? There's nothing in the lab!!
.

250
It's so sad... all because of those Xer's this place has basically become a ghost town.
I was just coming by to see my old inn. I miss running the shop and seeing friendly faces every day...
.

251
Sigh... Guess there's no need to get the flight license now huh.
I mean, you can go back and save Tobi and then get it if you want but, we're already here.
"Save" Tobi... Yeah, well anyway. This house is where I grew up. It's abandoned now though.
You can go inside if you want to but there's practically nothing in there.
I brought you here because this is as close as we can get to where Gad'riel is.
Unfortunately, this area isn't exactly documented very well either...
All I know is that there's a town South of here, and an ancient town around somewhere too.
The townspeople in the ancient village should know what we have to do to stop Gad'riel.
I'll come along with you once we get close. For now, I'm gonna hang around here.
.

252
This town is still currently being worked on. You can walk around but there's not much to do.
There will be some fun sides quests that happen here and things to unlock but not much story content.
.

253
I hope the professor and all his assistants in the lab are doing ok!
It could just be my imagination, but I could've sworn I saw some Xer grunts sneaking in and out of there..
.

254
At night this town is completely overrun, no one lives here.
I just came because Aki rang me. We used to live here together.
Now, I live in the town straight South from here.
There's a powerful Ranger who lives there and trains some apprenatices so it's quite safe.
.

255
This forest and it's creatures are weeping... I don't enjoy the time I spend here.
.

256
What are you lookin' at son? Can't you see a man's busy?
.

257
Cave training with the boss today on a new assignment!!
.

258
Special orders from boss, I'm so excited!
.

259
I hope boss lets me rig the cave with booby traps!
.

260
I'm looking for a ninja master that's somewhere on this mountain...
I heard he was so strong he could even take out rocks with his bare fists!
.

261
What'd you come back here for?
.

262
It's rare to get visitors these days.
Before the neighboring town got overrun by Dokimon we got lots of shoppers coming here.
Nowadays it's basically just one merchant looking over another just to get by.
.

263
Those twins always kinda creep me out...
But, this is the only Hospital for miles, so I don't have much of a choice.
.

264
No fair.. I didn't know you were strong! I thought I was just going to have relaxing battle...
But, no. You won fair and square. You've certainly earned the right pass through here.
Like I said though, you'll need more than just a surfboard.
I heard the mechanic is working on something interesting for water traversal, he lives right nearby.
.

265
It's not easy being a man in the current state of the world...
I have seen more people die before my eyes than any one person should ever have to see and live through.
.

266
The area past this point is incredibly dangerous.
You won't be allowed passage unless you're able to defeat Master Choi.
.

267
I wasn't able to save them... Another life, just, slipped through my fingers...
I was never good at remembering faces my whole life.
But after starting this line of work, I came to remember the faces of the lives I couldn't save.
Even if I only saw them for a split second before disaster, I can never forget.
In my dreams, I'm starting to see more faces of people I've lost than those that are close to me..
.

268
Oh! A visitor all the way out here? That's rare.
Let me see your Ranger card for a minute.
. . .
Ahh, yeah. Sorry, you can't enter unless you beat Azula.
She's in the town just before this, she's quite strong though.
But, you should be fine if you're able to walk around here without a worry on your face. Ha!
.

269
I feel like I've seen this somewhere before...
.

270
That was a great battle. Tell Choi I said hello if you end up going to her town and meeting her.
I'm holed up in the lab so even though she's quite close we hardly get the chance to meet.
.

271
This used to be quite the bustling little market town before the incident several years ago.
Thankfully I'm experienced with Dokimon battling so I can still make the trip but, it sure is lonely.
.

272
You've done well to defeat me. You should be able to manage yourself in the route above without issue.
Do be careful regardless though, of course. The Dokimon here are particularly strong, and... smart.
Even someone like me would find themselves in a bind if they got caught up in an ambush.
There's also other general dangers, like darkness, cliffs, ledges, and so on.
But, anyway. Come back to my dojo any time if you wanna train, or chat! I don't get many visitors.
.

273
There's some crazy strong Dokimon in that forest but the old geezers in town won't tell us where they are!
.

274
Are you SURE this is where he said!?
.

275
Come on man how little faifth in me do you have!
I'm sure of it, there's no doubt in my mind! I've never been more confident about something in my life!
That old man gave us the stick, down to his last breath. There's just no getting through these guys.
.

276
Poor Aki. You can tell she's feeling reminiscent about her old hometown...
How are you coming along with defeating the rest of the Rangers by the way? Did you find Tobi yet?
Once you beat the rest of us Elites you'll be able to go to the ancient village.
Well, if you can find it after all... Even I've only been there once myself.
But, that was before it got overran by Xer's and bound Dokimon...
.

277
Heya! Did you wanna rest up with your monsters in the onsen?
Sure thing, give me just a second...
. . .
There you go! You guys stay as long as you like~
.

278
The last place that hasn't been overran by the Xer's...
Aki told them there would be absolute hell on Yor City if the Xer's ever touched her onsen, haha.
.

279
The portal will only open itself up to those with the pure of heart.
Unfortunately, Tenshi and I have never been able to enter...
Additionally, the portal closes immediately when someone enters, until they come back.
You'll be completely alone once you go through there. Make sure you're prepared.
.

280
My sister is on Gad'riel duty today. You can see her by passing into his domain.
Me and Miso here are just on normal guard duty, protecting the town.
If you're serious about taking on Gad'riel, make sure to rest up a lot first.
You can heal up with your team at the onsen above me, and there's lots of strong trainers here.
We also have a merchant that sells rare items, and wise people here that can give you advice.
Whenever you're ready to take him on, just head North of town, and you'll find yourself in his domain.
.


281
Ohhh man, that's the stuff. Maybe I'll skip going back to the shrine and just stay here.
Think anyone will get mad?? I mean, I did lose an eye and all that...
.

282
There's some mysterious magic about this town. In fact, there used to be lots of artifacts that came from here.
Some were actually real that I've seen in person with my own eyes, but some are just completely made up.
For example, there's a rumor about one item that lets you access portals that fairy Dokimon use.
What a load of crap, ha! But, I have seen special items that let you find fairy Dokimon more easily.
Apparently the fairy Dokimon hide in the pink grass.
The grass isn't actually pink, it's just normal grass. But the magic of the fairies makes it appear pink to us.
.

283
Them Xer folk are no joke! You'd do good to take them all out for good!
.

284
The Tenshi twins are extremely powerful. They have a destiny passed down to them for generations.
.

285
They skipped a Sunday AGAIN!? When IS this store open!?
This store has the best nikuman in the world! But the ole' geezer that runs the place plays too much Luv Life.
.

286
It's not easy living in a town that's always under attack.
But whenever I feel scared, standing next to where the Ranger Masters live calms me down.
.

287
I can't believe I finally made it all the way here! Those bounds monsters in that jungle were something else.
But the biggest challenge was the fight against the Tenshi Twins!
I had only heard rumors about them, to think they actually exist... and wield bound Dokimon at that!
Whew, what a finale. I can't wait to catch up on some sleep after soaking my bones in the onsen.
.

288
I finally got to see the Tenshi Twins in real life, I knew they were real!
Everyone always told me otherwise. It's kinda creepy how they talk at the same time though...
.

289
There's a rumor that there's actually 6 or even as many as 8 of the Tenshi Twins!
I think it's just balogney, but the rumor goes that they take shifts watching over this town.
Whenever they're not here, they're out living normal lives, or even working normal jobs. Ha!
.

290
My Kitsu is capable of changing into many different forms.
It's so cool! But I think his normal little self is the cutest. Hehe.
.

291
There's something charming but beautiful about staying in a town surrounded by darkness, yet safe.
The constant battle between Gad'riel's goons, and Dokimon Masters and Tenshi Twins must be stressful.
But, I guess why that's the reason they installed such a soothing onsen here huh!
.

292
It's quite easy to love a pretty flower, with a sweet scent.
But, on the other hand. It's not really easy to appreciate and love a simple little leaf.
However, there's something beautiful in those that are able to love the simple, normal, and ordinary.
.

293
Yick... Just looking in that direction gives me the heeba jeeba's! It's so... icky, and oozy. Gross!
.

294
Those Tenshi Twins are strong, super strong!
But no matter how strong they got, they never could enter all the way to where Gad'riel is...
They were raised being told it was their desteiny to defeat him once and for all, and save all of us.
But it appears they were not chosen... The closest they can get is just before the portal.
I know those two are "pure of heart", I just know it! There's gotta be something else.
Perhaps there's some kind of trick to it our elders didn't know, or just never shared with us...
.

320
Yasaka is always so gung-ho and full of energy. I swear, that kid will battle anyone in sight!
.

321
Why hello. Are you a friend of Yana perhaps?
Yana's gone off on some journey and made for quite the impressive battler!
You'll have to face off again them if you're looking for a challenge.
.

322
I don't know what it is about these stupid blockades but, they seem to go away as you battle.
In a different area from here, I noticed some blockades disappeared after I won some battles.
.

323
I really wanna go to Peachy Plateau, but I'm not strong enough to pass through the Ride on my own.
.

324
I wonder what Dokimon's favorite food is... Mine's steak!
.

325
I'm working on a device that will let you talk with Dokimon!
So far, I got the talking to them down good! But it's getting them to talk back that's difficult...
.

326
I've been enjoying myself playing a game called Nuumonsters!
It's fun, it's just... the region is creepily similar to my hometown.
I wonder if the developer is from around here?
.

327
I just got a shiny new pickaxe!
Now nothing will stand in my way. Smash!
.

328
Yaawn... I was here to do something, but I'm too sleepy to even remember what it was.
.

329
In this world, if someone's doorknob isn't visible, their house is probably locked.
But if you can see the doorknob, then they probably don't mind visitors coming in.
.

330
My husband works so much, it really stresses me out!!
Look, he even got a computer so he can work at home!
Sigh, what am I going to do with that man...
.

331
I hope Nuumonsters brings back special login event monsters like they did in the past!
The limited time log-in events always had me excited to login and play.
I've been eagerly awaiting the remake, but at least the dev has been doing other neat stuff in the meantime.

I'm so excited! I'm expecting the buyer of this home to arrive any minute.
.

333
D-Did you see that? In the sky, it wasn't a bird, nor a plane...
It was like, a Sparkling Pheonix!
.

334
I'm gonna be a famous Elite Battler when I grow up!
.

335
I've always wanted to own my very own pool table!
But, now that it's finally here, it just feels kind of silly...
.

336
Hello...
If you're looking for Elite Battler Yumeko...
She's all the way in the back of the cave...
But there's some things blocking your path....
You'll have to solve the maze...
and defeat her underlings to face her....
.

337
Everyone here just wants to battle...
Sometimes a girl just wants to talk! Ya know?
.

338
Oh, hi! There you are! I finally found you!!!
I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty!
What!? You don't have a car? Oh man...
.

339
In Nuumonsters, I accidentally pressed the DEL key on my favorite monster in my PC.
I think my poor Chisa is gone forever... She was an event monster!!!
.

340
Soon, I'll have a full homestead here!
Everything starts somewhere, right?
.

341
Hmm.. Nothing biting today..
.

342
I've heard about some people having dreams where they could experience impossible things!
For example, some people saw colors that don't exist in reality in their dreams!
It's crazy, it's unfathomable! Can you imagine seeing a NEW COLOR and then trying to explain it?
I'd do anything to see that... But those people must be super special or something.
Why? Well, because our range of color is limited by our brains, not by our eyes.
.

343
Hmph, just be glad I didn't use my magics in battle! I took it easy on you...
But hey, you're pretty strong so... I guess we can battle again sometimes, in the Battle Casino.
Huh? You don't know? Well, you'll have to go through Koi Cove first, but yeah, Battle Casino.
It's in Dandy Dunes which is directly South from here, lots of strong battlers gather there.
Maybe I'll get to see you there one day? Perhaps I'll use my dark magics next time ♡
But yeah, anyway. Koi Cove is pretty far from here, it's close to where you started.
If you see the Elite Ai there tell her I said hi! We live in similar "homes" so we get along well.
.

344
Welp, you bested me... You'll be able to explore South of Peachy Plateau now, where Yumeko stays.
Huh? Help me get out of here??
Oh! That's just a joke. I uh, live here...
.

345
You mean I have to go ALL THE WAY Back to Koi Cove?
This is ridiculous! And why isn't there a single train or taxi in this place!?
.

346
The sound of the waves against the snowy shore is like nothing else!
.

347
I could fish like this all day. In fact, I think I will!
.

348
I got the last normal Pickaxe that was on sale over in Peachy Plateau.
The only other one they had was absurdly expensive! I can't imagine paying that much for one.
.

349
It's so cold here. I wish my cute little Burnsby could warm me up...
.

350
I really wanna become an Elite trainer one day.
But I think I'm too lazy to do something like that.
.

351
*Chomp chomp*. This food is delicious!
Oi... Oi oi. Don't look at me with those sad, puppy dog eyes...
.

352
Why aren't you just billowing with energy and positivity~
I'm looking forward to the day that we can put our skills to test in battle!
.

353
I'm Elite Battler Lee...
Unfortunately Yana hasn't finished me yet......... Come back later D:
.

354
The sea monsters wore me out... I had no idea you were strong!
