Hey honey! I heard you're going out without your friends for now, right?
I understand, I hope you find clues about your lost friend as soon as possible!.
If you ever need to rest for a bit, swing back by the house.
Oh yeah! I almost forgot, I have some presents for you! Here, take this.
. . .
*You got the "Momma Radar!"*
"What the heck!?"
This here is super useful! If you ever get stuck, just give it a try and I'll come get you.
Ah, and take these too! Some of those nifty little capture cards, and some snacks!
*You got 5 Captals, and snacks!*
Be safe dear, come home again soon!

Isn't it so great that Maiko's back home? She's such a sweet little girl.
I know she doesn't remember anything, but I can tell. You're the entire world to that girl.
You did great ♡
I still can't believe some of the crazy stories you tell me about your adventure though.
I'm just glad that are everyone got home safely~
Now don't let your friends hog up the TV too much yeah? ♡ Dinner will be ready soon after all!

Hi honey! How are your adventures going?
Oh, let me take care of your monsters for you.

Omg, /name/ you're finally awake!!
Now we're just waiting for Ai to get up. Where could she be?

Wow, what an intense match! I think Ai wants to battle with you too. Don't hold back!
.

Ahh, why if it isn't /name/! Mm, quick favor. As you know, I do have some news for you and your friends.
There is, erm, one issue however. We haven't been able to find Ai all day.
Someone said she might've gone to the forest, but I didn't want Koi to know about that.
Besides, you have the most Dokimon experience here, and I see you have Whispurr with you today!
Whispurr: *Briii!*
Yes, yes. Anyway, could you go find our little green Ai for me?
Like I was saying earlier, she may be in the forest, which is directly left from here.
If you check there, please be careful. Come back once you find Ai please, thank you!
.

2.1
Hey /name/.. It looks like Ai won't be able to leave with you and Koi after all..
It's a shame you two have to leave on such bad news, but, I'm sure she will join you soon.
I know how badly you guys all wanted to leave town together.
She's been directed to rest at home for a few days, come back to visit her soon ok?
Without further ado, will you two please meet me in the route above town?
It's time for you to start your adventure, you've waited far long enough. It's time to leave.
.

2.2
Welcome everyone! Everyone is finally old enough to go off on your own.
I'm sure you and Whispurr will have a lot of fun, and make many new friends soon!
These little ones will miss you too.
Once Ai's all rested up, I'm sure you all can adventure together like you always planned!
Anyways, go let your mother know you're leaving kiddo. It might be a while before you come back.
.

2.3
Hello /name/! How are you doing? I hope your adventures are going well.
If you ever find something big, be sure to tell your small-town professor about it!
.

Heyo /name/! Great work on finding Maiko, that's such an incredible feat! We couldn't have done it without you.
It's too bad about her memory... But me and the team are working hard on a solution!
I'm not sure if we'll ever succeed with it, but you did your part, so leave the science to me!
Ah, speaking of science... There's been some commotion in the science space recently.
Apparently some portal just opened up over the water out of nowhere after you defeated Gad'riel.
If you're ever feeling up for a new adventure, wanna check it out? It's north of Tinywoods, by Aki's shrine.

Heyo /name/, I think the professor was looking for you somewhere in town.
Looks like you can't go out though anyway, these little ones here are playing and blocking the way!!
.

3.1
HUH! What? I wasn't fishing!!!!
Oh, it's just /name/, phew!
What can I help you with?
...
Oh, you need to get through these caves? I see! Sure thing, let me get my Guardian Team ready.
Right now I just have my little Flounders and, that wouldn't make for much of a battle. Ha!
Actually, this is my house right here to the right. I'll meet you inside in a few minutes.

3.3
Wow! Congratulations /name/. You did a great job!
With this, you'll be able to pass through the caves and go on to the next town.
You've certainly earned the right to do so, but be careful nonetheless!
With that said, let me mark your victory in your Ranger ID Card. With a Gemstone!
. . . . .
There you go! You're all set. Good luck with your adventures!

This is troubling... The Dokimon are quite riled up from the tension.
Curses.. I had a meeting in the city today.

Heyo, were you looking for Ai?
We haven't seen her since she left this morning. I assumed she was out playing with you.
.

5.1
Hey honey. Ai's in her room sleeping. I think it's best to let her rest for a while..
She's doing fine so don't you worry about it. She's gonna be better and out there with you guys soon!
.
5.2
Ohh I'm so glad Aki is out and running around again! She told me about playing with you.
She's having so much fun and she really looks up to you and Koi. Take good care of her please!
.
5.3
I'm so glad all you kids are back home safe ♡
Oh, what's that? Ai's eating over at your place again? Aww, well... I'll let it slide.
But make sure you tell her to come home for dinner tomorrow, and to bring Maiko too! ♡

Whoa- Wah!! Wh-who are you??
What? An intruder??
Look man, I'm not cut out for this work after all. Here, take this, just don't tell anyone I-I'm..
SCARED of this place!!
...
*You got a Yuujyou Orb*
Look man, I don't know what it does. But it's supposed to be some top secret tech we made.
It's a good enough bribe right? So just leave me alone!

Isn't it just so comfy in here! I LOVE working where I live!!!! Who needs privacy anyway?

If you go straight East from here, you can reach the next town through a cave system.
Just above that town is where the Sage lives, she can probably be more help to you than I can.
However.. It looks like you haven't defeated any Guardian Rangers yet.
Guardian Rangers restrict outsiders from entering dangerous areas, and those caves are one of those places.
However, since you're a Dokimon Ranger you'll be able to go there if you defeat Haru in a battle.
He wanders around here and the town below us, but I think I saw him around here recently. Go try finding him!
.
7.2
Heyo! I heard you were able to defeat Haru without a hitch, that's great!
I hope you find some clues about your missing friend there uhh what'syerface.
Speaking of friends, you wouldn't happen to have any blue or green friends would you?
A couple of girls I've never seen around here before were asking similar questions to you.
I basically gave them the same answer I gave to you and they headed East.
Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in your adventures!
.
7.3
Heyo /name/! Long time no see.
Oh? What's this you got here, you said you found this in a cave next to some Lava?
Hmm hmm.. Yes this is quite interesting indeed, you can definitely tell it's radiating some kind of energy.
This is interesting! Thank you for making my work life more fun, let me take a proper look at this.
Oh, WAIT! I almost forgot. Two people came here asking about you today.
Maybe they're your friends? It was a little green one and a little blue one.
They said they'd meet up with you in Tinywoods, which is directly East from here.
Anyway, come back after a while and hopefully I'll be able to let you know what this is!
.
7.4
Heyo, how's it going /name/. Were you able to meet up with your friends in Tinywoods Town?
I'm still studying that smooth stone you gave me.
It's really interesting though, I think I'm on the verge of a breakthrough! Maybe, probably..
Just give me a little more time and I'll be able to let you know what this is!
.

Huh, hey wait a second! This fairy stone is suddenly... Wait, what's going on here?
. . . . . .
*CRACK*
""HUH!?""
It just suddenly, broke open!!/n/Ara? What might this little creature be??
. . .
*You befriended a Fire Fairy!*/n/They hopped into your backpack.
WOW! What is this!? Is this a Dokimon? This is incredible! Oh my, I have to report this to Rei!
Hmm, this little one seems extremely attracted to you for some reason.. She's fixed on that stone of yours.
Maybe you should take her along with you? Let me contact Rei first really quickly...
. . .
. . . . . .
. . . . . . . . .
Hmm hmm. Rei sounds pretty busy, even for something as incredible as this.
How about you hold on to this little guy for now? No idea what I'd do with it anyway...
*You got the Fire Fairy. This "item" will allow you to take out logs blocking your path.*
*There's more fairies later in the game too. They let you take out other obstacles.*
*Try to collect them all while playing the game to uncover all the secret monsters, areas, and items!*

Hello! Welcome to Surf Ship, the only traveling Surfboard merch-
Wait, if that isn't /name/! Funny to run into you here, I'm actually volunteering today.
Hey, don't tell this to anyone but, I'm supposed to give out 3 surfboards to random visitors but..
I'm gonna give you one! Don't worry, business has been slow today anyway.
Oh, but you're gonna have to take your surfing lessons else where. There's a contest going on here.
Here you go.
*Received a Surfboard*
Now you should be able to surf all you want! Shall I teach you how to do it?
It's real easy! All you have to do is run off a dock real, real fast.. and boom!
Before you know it you'll be surfing the seven seas atop your new floatation device. Fun right?
When you want to stop surfing, you just do the opposite. Dive full speed into a dock and you'll be back on land.
I believe there's places to surf South of your Hometown, and also in the town directly West from there.
Since it's your first time, why don't you go to the beach town West from your home town?

Go give it a try! It's a blast, and you can reach new areas that were otherwise unreachable!

Go on ahead! You've earned the right to enter the sacred fairy temple.
Well, since you're with Aki that is. Looks like she already rushed inside too!
But yeah, normal people can't just waltz in here even if they beat me.
It was a pleasure battling with you though! Come back to my town any time.
.
9.1
It's terrible what happened to Aki! I really can't believe it..
Aki comes here from time to time to seek out visions in there, but not very often.
This is the first time anything like this has ever happened though...
She's getting treatment in Xelos City, that big Mega City not far from Passaway Caves.
Maybe you should go see her? Xelos City is basically in the center of the region.
Though, watch out for scorpion-like Dokimon.. I heard there was an infestation recently!

Nope! Sorry kid, nooo entry. Nothing will move me from this post. Nothing, nope. Not a thing.
Well, not unless you had the new copy of that game everyone's raging about...
But that's impossible! It's said to be sold out for months. Anyway, beat it!

Hi! I'm Lilith, but you can just call my Lily. I take after my Witch mother of the same name! Teehee.
You came here because you seek something, right? Perhaps you're stuck and need a way out?
Well look no further! Take a stroll downstairs and I'll be right behind you. Teehee!

Hey punk, what do you think you're looking at?
Huh!? Don't be staring at the door, it's none of your business!
There's not a thing in the world that will get me to leave my post!
Well, unless you had some coupons for that new game that comes out today..
But that's impossible! They're basically all expired by now.
.
12.1
What!? You got a coupon for the game?? Lemme see this...
You only have one? Look, I'm an Xer. What do I look like, I'm made of money??
I'm not moving an inch!
Well, unless you had another coupon. Then maybe I might just go home and follow a life of piece..
But that's not gonna happen, so scram!
.

12.2
Not you again! What could you possibl-
Huh? You found another one?? A second coupon??
Well! I'm still not lea- man gimme those!

Alright listen, you slip by real quick and I'll act like I didn't notice.

Thank you for saving me, /name/.
I'm sorry, I still don't remember anything... Even my name, Maiko, I only know because you told me it.
But, it seems like I had some really good friends when I lived in this town.
It's too bad we weren't able to grow up together like normal friend groups...
But, we can make lots of new memories together! And, you have such strong Dokimon to protect us with too.
I know we're not really the same age anymore because of where I was all this time.
Maybe there will be times when I have to ask for help, or things we can't do together until I get bigger.
But for the first time in many years, I'm not alone anymore. So, thank you, /name/.
I owe everything to you, Ai, and Koi. I...
I just wish my Mom could see me now... It's too bad she's not around anymore.
But, your Mom is so nice, and you take care of me too. So I never feel lonely anymore.
We're in this together, /name/.
Whatever hardships come our way moving forward, they'll be nothing compared to what we've faced, surely.
Thank you.
